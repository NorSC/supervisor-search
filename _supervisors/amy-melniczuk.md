  Note: If the above timeslots are inconvenient for you, email me, and we can try to make it on another day. In addition, to save you precious time, even though you will come on Mondays and Fridays, it is still good to email me in case I am not in the office for unexpected tasks. 


  Note: From Oct 9-13, I will attend a conference and will not be in the office.

  I have successfully supervised 16 bachelor's students at the University of
  Munich in Germany. We evaluate the thesis study in Germany from 1 (the best)
  to 5 (the worst). Thirteen of my students got 1. I enjoy working with my
  students. If you are interested in working on my given topics, email me. We
  can discuss a specific research topic based on your interests. Working on the
  projects you are motivated and interested in is crucial for me. 


  My research interests are hardware computing, mobile interaction, embodied interaction, and collaboration. My current work focuses on designing and developing [tangible user interfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangible_user_interface#:~:text=A%20tangible%20user%20interface%20represents,range%20of%20possible%20application%20areas.) to help users interact with the computer more accessible and intuitively.Â Specifically, I am interested in the following topics:


  * Tangible User Interfaces for collaboration

  * Enhance mobile interaction in business

  * Explore gamification mechanics in user experience

  * Increase work or learning productivity with collaborative tools


  **Project type:** all the projects will be *investigative/research-focused,* you need to build a product and conduct user studies to test your product. The product can be a mobile application, a physical artefact, or a website. 


  Get in touch if any of the above ideas excite you or have sparked a new idea for a Human-Computer Interaction project you would like to discuss with me.
