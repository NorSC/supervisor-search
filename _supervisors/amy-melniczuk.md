  I have successfully supervised 16 bachelor's students at the University of
  Munich in Germany. We evaluate the thesis study in Germany from 1 (the best)
  to 5 (the worst). Thirteen of my students got 1. I enjoy working with my
  students. If you are interested in working on my given topics, email me. We
  can discuss a specific research topic based on your interests. Working on the
  projects you are motivated and interested in is crucial for me. 


  Currently, my research interests are tangible interaction, active learning, and learning community. The main goal is to transform traditional lecture-based education with students' active engagement in a learning community environment and how tangible interaction can facilitate this process. This ranges from the explorations of what physical visualizations can facilitate student group process in the classroom and accordingly what interactions can be realized in this context. In specifically, I am interested to the following topics:


  * Tangible User Interfaces (TUIs) for collaborative learning

  * Tangible Interaction for creative learning, such as drawing and music composition

  * Augmented reality for inquiry learning in the traditional face-to-face or remote learning environment

  * Gamified learning for children

  * Build community knowledge base to facilitate collectively inquiry learning
