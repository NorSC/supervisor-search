  **For BSc students:**


  I have successfully supervised 16 bachelor's students at the University of Munich in Germany. We evaluate the thesis study in Germany from 1 (the best) to 5 (the worst). Thirteen of my students got 1. I enjoy working with my students. If you are interested in working on my given topics, email me. We can discuss a specific research topic based on your interests. Working on the projects you are motivated and interested in is crucial for me. It is worth mentioning if you want to work with me, I hope you will get the best grades. In other words, if you want to pass the thesis study, I am sorry, but I might not be your ideal supervisor. 


  **For MSc Students**


  I have successfully supervised 5 master's students at the University of Munich in Germany. We evaluate the thesis study in Germany from 1 (the best) to 5 (the worst). All my students got 1. I enjoy working with my students. If you are interested in working on my given topics, email me. We can discuss a specific research topic based on your interests. 


  **It is worth mentioning:**


  * Working on the projects you are motivated and interested in is crucial for me. Therefore, **do make an appointment with me first to discuss your interests**. My email address is amy.melniczuk@northumbria.ac.uk. Usually, I can reply to you in less than two days. 

  * If you want to work with me, I hope you will get the best grades. In other words, if you want to pass the thesis study, I am sorry, but I might not be your ideal supervisor.


  **For Ph.D. Students**


  I have studied and worked in China, Canada, Germany, Switzerland, and now in the UK. I have no Ph.D. supervision experience, but I am confident that I know how to help you succeed. It is a big decision to start a Ph.D. Getting a Ph.D. at Northumbria University might not be an optimal decision compared to a top-ranking university like Cambridge University. However, I have seen many friends graduate from not very well-known universities but get good jobs. My bachelor's supervisor told me **the secret**: 


  > *If you can not be one of the best students in a university you think does not deserve you, how can you be confident that you will be successful in a top university?*
