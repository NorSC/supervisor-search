  I'm hidden away on the third floor of E block. If you come in to the Zone entrance on Northumberland Road and follow the signs for Think Lab you'll come to an open lab/soft seating/computer terminals space. I'll either be in the lab, or the office next door (E305).

  My research interests centre on informal learning in computer science. A live outreach/engagement project, [Connect](https://nustem.uk/connect/), involves late primary-aged children (approx. 9-11 years old) working alongside their parents/carers to build electromechanical puppets operated by a microcontroller. The controllers are networked and use IoT protocols to exchange simple 'mood' messages between puppets. The task, workshop activities, mechanical and coding components are all tailored with the aim of prompting exploratory, 'tinkering' behaviour and conversations amongst participants.


  ## Project idea


  A key component of the Connect system is a servo motor control system, which builds on established libraries to allow the programmer to articulate complex animation sequences with minimal code. The current library is written in C++ and targets the Arduino platform.


  The [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/) platform is rapidly growing in popularity, particularly with the MicroPython runtime. This project would therefore aim to port the existing C++/Arduino servo animation library to MicroPython/Pi Pico. Along the way, you might:


  * Assess, critique and reimagine design decisions made in the original (Arduino) implementation.

  * Design (and implement) a coherent Python API with similar objectives.

  * Write documentation and example code to support users.

  * Investigate packaging as a python module for straightforward distribution and use.


  There are some slightly gnarly corners to navigate, several digressions or extensions you might choose to pursue, and some simplifications which could be made if necessary. You'll also be working in the constrained environment of microcontrollers. Also: playing with cute cardboard robots.
