  I've three project suggestions this year, which between them cover the range
  of my research and practice interests.


  ## Expressive servo movement: animation library development for Micropython


  Servo motors are typically controlled to move to a specific angle as rapidly as possible. In some applications, smoothed movement is desirable. However, no good smoothing/easing movement library exists in the Micropython ecosystem. So... let's build one.


  For a recent (Arduino-based) family learning project we extended eased movement to an animation queue model, which allowed relatively complex multi-servo animation sequences to be expressed via a simple API. Bringing that across to Micropython would be very useful indeed.


  Requirements: Python, C++, physical computing, object oriented programming.


  ## Real-time visitor analytics in a museum


  Museums and visitor centres typically have a range of areas where visitors might interact with staff: shows and performances, specific exhibits, hands-on or drop-in areas, interactive trolleys, and so on. Conventionally, staff in each of these areas count visitors using mechanical clickers, and enter the data into a logbook at the end of their shift.


  This project will explore opportunities, benefits, costs and risks of substituting a networked digital system for the manual clickers:


  - Data capture, using Arduino/Micropython-based network devices.

  - Data storage, using (presumably) a central database

  - Data presentation, offering a dashboard to provide real-time analytics to office staff.


  There are multiple issues and challenges around each stage of this, but it's also a 'live' project we have ongoing with a local visitor centre.


  Requirements: physical computing, data science, IoT


  ## Data architecture, platform choice and interaction design for an education resource website


  The Faculty's NUSTEM outreach group have an existing website, built on Wordpress. One area of the site offers teachers a catalogue of STEM career examples, organised by national curriculum area. It's surprisingly popular. Surprising, because the current implementation of the site is decidedly clunky.


  In this project develop a fresh website which presents the same data set ... only better. You'd think through the audience and client needs, cross-evaluate development platforms, and develop a new interaction model to improve access to the resource.


  You may wish to gather formal or informal feedback via user testing, a steering/focus group, or apply other research and assessment techniques of interest.


  This project may alternatively be supervised by Prof. Becky Strachan.


  Requirements: web, database, interaction design, data architecture
