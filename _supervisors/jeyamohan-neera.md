  * **Federated Learning based forecasting models for Healthcare Emergencies
  (Pandemic Response)**

    This project aims to build privacy-preserving data aggregation and analytical solutions to enable access to health and mobility data that will aid us in forecasting tasks related to public health emergencies. As a result, the resulting solutions will aid governments to strengthen their response capabilities which can pave the way to effective management for future emergencies such as pandemics. Forecasting individual-level risk during a pandemic is challenging as it depends on multiple factors, such as the prevalence of the disease in the community, interactions the individual has had with those already infected, and health-related attributes that may make an individual more susceptible to infection. There are currently challenging trade-offs between enabling sufficient access to data to build tools for effectively modelling infection risk, whilst ensuring that sensitive health and mobility data are kept confidential. Hence, through this project, a student will plan to implement a forecasting model which will be able to predict an individual’s risk and simultaneously protect their privacy.
  * **Federated Learning based recommendation model for Video recommendation (Front and Back-end development)**

    Third-Party Service Providers tend to collect implicit feedback from users to tackle the data sparseness problem. They can easily collect implicit feedback from a user by monitoring their actions such as purchase history, navigation history, browsing habits, etc. However, like explicit feedback, even implicit feedback aggregated from users can cause privacy violations and reveal sensitive information about them to untrustworthy service providers. Federated Learning-based recommendation systems are introduced to tackle privacy concerns and offer strong privacy protection to users from untrustworthy service providers. A federated learning-based recommendation system distributes the model training process among its users, ensuring that user data never leaves their devices and enhancing their privacy protection. Federated matrix factorization is one of the most frequently used federated CF models to produce personalized recommendations. This project aims to train and deploy a federated matrix factorization model to tackle this problem.
  * **Honeypot coupled machine learning model for botnet detection and classification**

    IoT devices are widely used in smart factories from production to distribution. However, the number of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks conducted using Botnets targeting these smart factories has been increasing and threatens the business continuity of an organization. Hence, it is important to improve a smart factory’s defensive capability. Among many security solutions, botnet detection using a honeypot is effective. A honeypot can detect botnets by creating a replica of actual network resources. As a result, whenever a botnet attacks these false resources, the honeypot can record the traffic information in a log file. In addition, these log files are classified using a machine learning-based intrusion detection model. The information related to the botnets then gets transferred to the network administrator who in return can create new intrusion prevention rules to protect the network. Hence, productivity increases, while the stability of the smart factory is reinforced.
  * **Privacy enhancing solution for Financial Fraud Prevention**

    This project idea focuses on enhancing cross-organization, and cross-border data access to support efforts to combat fraud, money laundering and other financial crime. This project intends to develop innovative, privacy-preserving federated learning solutions to enable the detection of potentially anomalous transactions. “Anomalous transactions” cover a range of payments that vary significantly from the normal transactions that are conducted in a customer’s account. For example, a transaction that is of an unexpectedly large amount of money, a transaction taking place between the unusual receiver and sender, has unusual timestamps or contains other unusual information. The datasets that are available to train and test models are labelled. Hence it is not required for the student to have a detailed understanding of financial transactions.
  * **Investigation on Legislations and User Perspective on Extreme Pornography material sharing on popular social media site**

    The structure of someone's social network is fundamentally related what interests that person holds. 
    People often gravitate towards topics that are relevant to them, forming social groups that revolve around 
    these subjects. Online social media are also favourable ecosystems for the formation of communities 
    centred on matters that are not publicly discussed because of the embarrassment, discomfort, or ethical/moral dilemma. Those are communities that depict or discuss what are usually referred to as deviant behaviours, conducts that are commonly considered inappropriate because they are somehow violative of society's norms or moral standards that are shared among the majority of the members of society. In this topic I would like to investigate such behaviours and understand the ethical and moral dilemma behind such actions. Also additionally I would like to investigate how the existing legal structures are tackling these behaviours (whether they are considered lawful or unlawful). If it is unlawful what are the consequences these groups and people have to face. I also would like to understand and derive a behaviour profile for a victim or the offender.
