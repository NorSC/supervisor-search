  My research interests include bioinformatics, computational biology,
  statistics, image processing, and machine learning. Please see my project
  proposals below and feel free to contact me if you have any questions or if
  you want to discuss any project ideas related to my research interests. 


  T﻿hose are simply AI projects in which you use some techniques e.g. to predict sub-groups in a cancer cohort or predict the tumour stage of a selected cancer type.


  Note: Experience with (or willing to learn) Python and/or R is necessary 


  **Project #1: Prediction of the groups in a colon cancer cohort by integrating different types of big biological datasets**


  Aim: Predicting sub types in a colon cancer cohort using gene expression data collected from patients. 


  The dataset is publicly available and can be also provided by the supervisor.


  Steps:


  1. Preparing data (cleaning noise, normalisation, removing/handling missing values, etc)

  2. F﻿eature (gene) selection 

  3. Using the selected features (genes) and predicting the optimum 'k' value for k-means clustering among 2<=k<=10 (e.g. elbow method or silhouette index can be used)

  4. (optional - and if the survival data of the patients is available) Label/group the samples based on the k-means clustering with the optimal 'k' value and compare the overall survival of the sub-populations using the ‘Kaplan-Meier’ estimator.




  **Project #2: Tumor stage prediction in colon cancer with transfer learning using pathological tissue images**


  Aim: Classification of the tumor stages in a colon cancer cohort using Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained pathological tissue images. 


  Image dataset and patients' metadata are publicly available and will be downloaded from TCGA portal (or can be provided by the supervisor). Tumor stage info (and the other relevant clinical and demographics data) of each patient is available in the metadata.


  This is an image processing project and multiple CNN models (e.g. VGGXX, InceptionvXX, ResNetXX) are expected to be re-trained and compared for the tumor stage classification task.
