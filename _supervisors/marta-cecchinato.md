  I have two broad research interests within the field of **HCI** and would love
  to supervise projects in this space: **Future of Work** and **Digital
  Wellbeing**. I'm also particularly interested in **Equality and Diversity
  issues** that cut across these themes. Below are some of the projects I am
  hoping to supervise, but please get in touch if you have a project idea that
  is related.


  **1. Reimagining gig-work (investigative project/general project)**


  The gig economy is changing how people work, promising flexible and easy ways to earn money, but the reality is that gig platforms often hinder the autonomy and growth of workers. The gig economy is also referred to as the '[sharing economy](https://www.brenthecht.com/publications/cscw2018pacm_sharingeconomylitreview.pdf)', where capital-intensive good are shared: this could be someone's car (e.g. Uber), someone's house (e.g., Airbnb), someone's time (e.g. TaskRabbit), or someone's knowledge (e.g. [Upwork](https://nrl.northumbria.ac.uk/id/eprint/45264/1/chi21b_sub7788_cam_i16.pdf)). There is a call to move towards more collaborative worker-centred gig economy, however how this happens is not clear and it will vary between different types of gig work. Specifically, [Alkhatib et al. (2018)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.08189.pdf) have identified 7 areas to further explore when designing more collaborative gig platforms. This project would build on existing work to either apply Alkhatib et al.'s work in a specific context (e.g. Uber drivers) and understand the unique needs of workers for a more collaborative platform, or expand on one of the 7 recommendations to propose design solutions following a user-centred design model.


  If you are interested or just curious about this project, I would recommend signing up to this [free online event (28 and 29 October) on Digital Worker Inquiry: Data, Solidarity and Leverage](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/digital-worker-inquiry-data-solidarity-leverage-tickets-157812043069?aff=eemailordconf&utm_campaign=order_confirm&utm_medium=email&ref=eemailordconf&utm_source=eventbrite&utm_term=viewevent), as there will be a showcase worker-led data projects, ranging from the creation of apps, tools, and software to the discussions of the ethical, technical, and legal challenges of working with or organising through worker data


  **2. Socially intelligent meetings (investigative project/general project)**


  COVID-19 has profoundly disrupted the ways we work, with many people now enjoying working from home as a result of spending time setting up their workstations. As things are slowly going back to 'normal', new forms of hybrid and blended working are emerging, where teams work partially at home and partially in the office. This can affect collaborative work in particular, such as meetings. While hybrid meetings (where there is a mix of remote and in-person participation) are not new, the technology to support these has still a long way to go. Microsoft Research has been leading the way around hybrid meetings (see [guidelines here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/the-new-future-of-work/articles/hybrid-meetings-guide/), and recent publications such as about [online meeting chats](https://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/id/eprint/152899/1/2021_CHI_LBW_parallel_chat_author_own_version_custom_footer_1_.pdf) and [how AI can support online meetings](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Samiha-Samrose/publication/351422187_MeetingCoach_An_Intelligent_Dashboard_for_Supporting_Effective_Inclusive_Meetings/links/60bad8dd92851cb13d799384/MeetingCoach-An-Intelligent-Dashboard-for-Supporting-Effective-Inclusive-Meetings.pdf)). This project would look at how technology can better support participation, engagement and inclusivity, while accounting for power dynamics during hybrid meetings. Note that this could be applied to a work context (you could even have a client such as your placement company), or in an education context (think about teaching experiences). Alternatively, this project could take a broader lens and just focus on how to re-imagine workspaces in a hybrid world.


  **3. Alternative metrics for Digital Wellbeing (investigative project/general project)**


  We often hear in news and media reports how people are 'addicted' to technology and how screen time is bad. As a result, the term Digital Wellbeing has emerged and often refers to how people use technology in their day to day life and the impacts it may have on their wellbeing. However, there is no common definition of what this actually means. Companies like Google, Apple and others have started to introduce time tracking metrics on apps and devices to help users understand how much time they spend doing certain activities. This has resulted in an over-simplification of what Digital Wellbeing solutions might look like, reducing our complex interactions with technology to a number. [Building on a workshop I organised with experts on the topic and industry participants from Google, Huawei and Microsoft Research](https://digitalwellbeingworkshop.wordpress.com/discussions/), this project would look at identifying a user group that could benefit from digital wellbeing solutions, and [co-designing](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.306.9795&rep=rep1&type=pdf) with them potential solutions that help them value their use of technology but are not limited to time tracking. One possible solution could be the [use of design frictions](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1475258/), small hurdles introduced within the interaction to make users more mindful of how they use technology. How these frictions are introduced would need to be explored further in the project.


  **4. Gender inequalities in the gig economy (investigative project)**


  Women generally earn less than men in many labour contexts. Women are also often disadvantaged in career progression compared to men as a result of the inequalities around unpaid labour, such as housework and childcare. The growing gig economy allows for more flexible ways of working, especially in remote ways, and this can open more possibilities for women to work around other commitments. However, recent studies have shown there are gender differences in pricing strategies for online labour: women generally ask for less money than men. Work by Foong et al. ([2018](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3274322) and [2021](http://www.eurekafoong.com/documents/foong_gerber_chi2021_genderpricing.pdf)) has identified a number of future directions to further address these inequalities, such as creating 'gig literacies', develop new socio-technical interventions, and off-platform design interventions. This project could further investigate gender inequalities in gig platforms and payment structures, or develop and evaluate new solutions that minimise such inequalities. I'm also open to discuss broader topics around gender issues in new forms of work.


  For a broader view of my research interests and what I work on, [have a look at my publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=FkS0CT8AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).\

  Get in touch if any of the above ideas excite you or have sparked a new idea for a **Human-Computer Interaction project** you would like to discuss with me.
