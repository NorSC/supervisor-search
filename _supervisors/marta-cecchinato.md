  My research interests fall under the field of **H﻿uman-Computer Interaction**.
  I am particularly interested in supervising projects that speaks to
  Sustainable Development Goals and that focus around these broad areas and how
  they apply to HCI/computing:


  * **Future of work** (e.g. gig economy, c﻿ontent creator economy, w﻿orkplace surveillance, flexible working) 

  * **Digital wellbeing** (﻿e.g. at work, in education, in social contexts)

  * **Equality, diversity & inclusion** (﻿e.g. dismantling structural/systemic racial or gender bias, enabling wider participation of women in Computing)

  * **S﻿ustainable living** (e.g. behaviour change, food waste and recycling, active transport, raising awareness)


  Below are three specific project ideas I am hoping to supervise, but please get in touch if you have a project idea that is related. For a broader view of my research interests and what I work on, [have a look at my publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=FkS0CT8AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).




  **1. POST-DIGITAL SECURITY FOR SOCIAL AND LEISURE SURVEILLANCE**


  We live in a world that is moving towards 'digital by default', where technology is part of the fabric of our society. One of the consequences of this is that it has become incredibly easy to monitor and track our every activity, both online and offline. We saw this especially during Covid when many workplace surveillance platforms emerged to keep track of employees working from home. However, practices of surveillance happen also in our social lives, by noticing habits around digital behaviours (e.g., when does someone usually posts online, or where we can often find friends and family at certain times of the day). However, this surveillance is not always labelled as such and can often be considered part of a social or leisure life.


  For example, [dotwatching](https://dotwatcher.cc/page/6CO2ZfSWlyOkcQsG62iGaE%20) is the practice of watching dots move on a map during an endurance races (e.g. cycling). These events are often in remote locations and dotwatching allows people to follow a race from anywhere in the world and from the comfort of their sofa. Each rider is represented by a dot on the map, which includes their status, their position in the race, how long a person has stopped for, and how much time they've spent on and off the bike.  The dot map is also important for the riders as it is the only way most racers know where the others are. This is partly for safety, so that race organisers can see where their runners are at all times and spot if they’re off course or not moving for a long period. It’s also partly to check that all the runners are following the route correctly. However, there are many security and safety risks in sharing one's exact location for the whole world to view, putting oneself at risk of mugging or worse.


  This project will explore the trade-offs of social/leisure surveillance in a particular context (e.g. monitoring friends, tracking sport events, checking out a date, neighbourhood watch), how these might impact gender and minorities differently. The outcome of this work is expected to produce some design guidelines for users and developers when thinking about digital data traces and people centred-security.

  **2. DIGITAL CARBON FOOTPRINT OF COMPUTER SCIENCE STUDENTS**


  As we become more and more digital, our carbon footprint also grows. Fast-tracked by COVID-19, many people have been working remotely over the last couple of years. While there are environmental benefits to this (e.g. fewer travelling), it has also meant that our digital carbon footprint as increased. Using our devices daily consumes electricity, and during the pandemic our Internet use grew by 40% as a result of video conferencing, video streaming, online gaming ([International Energy Agency, 2021](https://www.iea.org/reports/data-centres-and-data-transmission-networks)). This is on top of the carbon footprint resulting from manufacturing our devices. It can be hard to visualise the environmental impact of our digital lives, especially when we think about cloud-based storage and data centres, which account for 2% of global energy demand ([International Energy Agency, 2021](https://www.iea.org/reports/data-centres-and-data-transmission-networks)). Currently, our digital devices, Internet and systems that support them account for a little less than 4% of greenhouse gas emissions, but data centres global emission alone are expected to grow to 14%  by 2040 (The Guardian). There are some strides to make devices more energy efficient (e.g. [Xbox energy saver mode](https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/5/23337587/game-console-energy-usage-mode-xbox-standby-instant-on-ps4-switch-compared%20)), but awareness needs to grow in order support behaviour change. Researchers have also found that different programming languages can be more or less energy efficient, w﻿ith Python being one of the least environmentally friendly languages, and C being the most environmentally friendly. (Pereira et al., 2017). 


  This project will investigate the awareness and habits of Computer Science students around their carbon footprint. It will compare students on different courses and living in different types of accommodations. The project can include product building, for example to develop a platform that provides tailored feedback and recommendations about one's own behaviours. Similarly, a product could be built to help monitor one's digital footprint or develop a game to increase awareness or change behaviour to be more sustainable.

  **3. GENDER INEQUALITIES IN THE GIG ECONOMY**


  Women generally earn less than men in many labour contexts. Women are also often disadvantaged in career progression compared to men as a result of the inequalities around unpaid labour, such as housework and childcare. The growing gig economy allows for more flexible ways of working, especially in remote ways, and this can open more possibilities for women to work around other commitments. However, recent studies have shown there are gender differences in pricing strategies for online labour: women generally ask for less money than men. Work by Foong et al. ([2018](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3274322) and [2021](http://www.eurekafoong.com/documents/foong_gerber_chi2021_genderpricing.pdf)) has identified a number of future directions to further address these inequalities, such as creating 'gig literacies', develop new socio-technical interventions, and off-platform design interventions.


  This project could further investigate gender inequalities in gig platforms and payment structures, or develop and evaluate new solutions that minimise such inequalities. I'm also open to discuss broader topics around gender issues in new forms of work.
