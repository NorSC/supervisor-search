additional_details: >-
  My research revolves around software architectures, especially for
  self-adaptive, cloud based and IoT software systems. I am currently focusing
  on the recent emerging architectures, e.g. microservices, serverless. I am
  also working on virtual research environments (VRE) for environmental science,
  green computing, and sustainability. Any research projects around these topics
  are welcome to discuss. Some ideas are listed below:


  * Measuring/ simulating carbon footprint of cloud-based software systems

  * Managing trade-offs between statistical accuracy of environmental data models and carbon footprint

  * Modelling and simulation of microservices software architecture

  * Modelling and simulation of serverless architecture

  * Virtual Research Environment for Digital Twins
