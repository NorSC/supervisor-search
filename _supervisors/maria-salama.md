additional_details: "My research revolves around software architectures,
  especially for self-adaptive, cloud based and IoT software systems. I am
  currently focusing on the recent emerging architectures, e.g. microservices,
  serverless, software defined networks. I am also working on virtual research
  environments (VRE) for environmental science, green computing, and
  sustainability. Any research projects around these topics are welcome to
  discuss. Some ideas are listed below:\r

  \r

  -\tMeasuring/ simulating carbon footprint of cloud-based software systems\r

  -\tManaging trade-offs between statistical accuracy of environmental data
  models and carbon footprint\r

  -\tModelling and simulation of microservices software architecture/
  serverless architecture/ software defined networks\r

  -\tVirtual Research Environment for Digital Twins\r

  \r\n"
