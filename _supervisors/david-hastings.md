  In addition to the subject areas listed in the themes and keywords sections
  above, I have previously supervised projects in the following areas (and would
  be happy to do so again):


  * Digital literacy & digital exclusion

  * Data visualisation and communication

  * Sports analytics

  * Finance and financial services

  * Business intelligence systems


  I very much encourage **self-instigated projects**, so if you have an idea for your project (ideally as a *core question* that you would like to answer, or a *phenomenon* that you would like to investigate) that you feel aligns with my interests, then please get in touch, and we can arrange a discussion. Alternatively, you may wish to choose one of the projects below: 


  **Developing a Dynamic Metric for the Assessment of Relative Team Quality in Football**

  The outcome of football (soccer) matches is notoriously difficult to predict. This difficulty is a result of the low-scoring, high-variance nature of the sport, but there has still been effort put into the development of methods to predict match outcomes as effectively as possible. Influenced by metrics such as Elo rating in chess, and credit ratings provided by firms such as Moodyâ€™s, this project proposes the development of a new comparative evaluation metric that produces a near real-time ranking of relative team quality. It is anticipated that the new metric will be developed from publicly available records of match outcomes, while the validity of the metric may be tested by real-world outcome analysis using a comparison of expected and actual results. 


  **Exploring Digital Entrepreneurship within the UK**

  Entrepreneurial businesses are a key component of most developed economies, contributing to wealth creation, job creation, and innovation efforts. In recent years, the rise of digital businesses has transformed the entrepreneurial landscape, lowering barriers to entry, and creating new opportunities for firms operating in the virtual and digital spheres. Using data collected by the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, this project will focus on UK-based businesses and will investigate the extent and nature of digital entrepreneurship, exploring the factors which contribute to positive outcomes for businesses of this nature.   


  If you have your own idea that you wish to work on or would be interested in working on the projects listed above, please get in touch at **david2.hastings@northumbria.ac.uk**, and we can arrange a meeting to discuss it further. Thanks!
