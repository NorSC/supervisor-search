  In addition to the subject areas listed in the themes and keywords sections
  above, I have previously supervised projects in the following areas (and would
  be happy to do so again):


  * Digital literacy & digital exclusion

  * Data visualisation and communication

  * Sports analytics

  * Finance and financial services

  * Business intelligence systems


  I very much encourage **self-instigated projects**, so if you have an idea for your project (ideally as a *core question* that you would like to answer, or a *phenomenon* that you would like to investigate) that you feel aligns with my interests, then please get in touch, and we can arrange a discussion. Alternatively, you may wish to choose one of the projects below: 


  **Investigating the impact of Generative AI on shaping the information ecosystem of students.** 

  Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLM), such as those in the GPT family, hold tremendous transformative potential. The way in which those involved in higher education (HE) gain access to information has evolved dramatically over the years, from using printed texts as the basis for information acquisition through to the early internet and onto modern search engines; LLMs may well serve as the next step on that path, able to provide consolidated information with only simple prompts as input. This project will investigate how the use of Generative AI and LLMs is shaping the information access and organisation habits of students in HE, and what that means for judgements around the value, legitimacy and relevancy of information. 


  **Investigating how technology can be used to support Digital Carers.**

  The term “Digital Carers” describes individuals who manage the online affairs of others who are less digitally literate, typically a family member or friend. Digital carers do not receive significant attention in the media or in policy, as their efforts usually remain unseen. This project will investigate technologies that can be used to support digital carers, identifying novel solutions which are able to improve the quality of life both for the carers and the individuals that they assist.  


  **Exploring the relationships between challenge, reward, and user enjoyment in digital games.** 



  **Exploring the potential of Generative AI in the creation of tailored marketing plans.** 


  If you have your own idea that you wish to work on or would be interested in working on the projects listed above, please get in touch at **david2.hastings@northumbria.ac.uk**, and we can arrange a meeting to discuss it further. Thanks!
