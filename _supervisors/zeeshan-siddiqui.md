  6. Decision Support Systems


  **Areas 'NOT' interested in**


  1. Machine Learning and Deep Learning (acceptable only if integrated with authentication)

  2. Web Design and Development

  3. Image Processing


  **Before contacting, please make sure :(BSc & MSc Students)**


  1. To have an idea that should enable you to achieve Mastery in your project (at the MSc level, there is no requirement to have a unique and novel idea, however, the idea should challenge you to achieve a Postgraduate level of Mastery we are looking into).

  2. To have an Abstract level understanding of the project

  3. To have the basic knowledge and understanding of the domain

  4. To have the understanding about the development tools used in the project


  **Before contacting, please make sure :(PhD Students)**


  1. To have a novel and innovative idea that enables you to either extend the existing work or propose a new solution to address the problem.

  2. To have an Abstract level understanding of the project.

  3. To have an initial literature review done to justify the project (10-15 studies).

  4. To have a clear research gap.

  5. To have an understanding of the Research Methodology.

  6. To have up to three Research Objectives.

  7. To have a working knowledge and experience of the development tools used in the project.

  8. To have a working knowledge and experience of the Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis tools used in Comparative Analysis.

  9. To have three years (if full-time) or six years (if part-time) project plan (Gantt Chart).

  10. To have a set of References or Bibliography.
