additional_details: I have an interest in, and can supervise projects around a
  diverse range of qualitative methods, ubiquitous use of computing in daily
  life, social media (in particular around visual analysis), tech for personal
  relationship building/maintenance and how people might use technology to
  scaffold and express their personal identity. This crosses over into the
  digital sociology aspects of HCI analysing the uptake/retention, use,
  motivation and subversion of computing by individuals or collective groups.
