  I strongly focus on several riveting and contemporary fields including Large
  Language Models (LLM), Machine Learning, and Data Science. For undergraduate
  students with a passion for exploring the intersection of technology and
  information, I offer supervision in projects that explore innovative
  applications of AI and Machine Learning in various scenarios, whether itâ€™s
  developing intelligent systems, creating predictive models, or applying
  algorithms in unprecedented manners.


  If your interests lie in exploring the facets of LLMs and leveraging them to bring about automation and sophisticated solutions in the technology sphere, I would be thrilled to guide you in unfolding the layers of this technology, providing a strong foundation for your future endeavours in academia or industry.

  Having extensively worked in the domain of Machine Learning and Data Science,
  I am eager to work with postgraduate students interested in deepening their
  understanding and application of these fields. For those inclined towards the
  application of AI and Machine Learning in business and other real-world
  scenarios, there is a myriad of research opportunities ranging from optimising
  business processes, enhancing decision-making, to uncovering patterns in
  consumer behaviour.


  I am particularly interested in supervising projects that not only delve into the theoretical aspects but also emphasize practical, real-world applications, ensuring that the students can contribute meaningfully to the ongoing technological advancements. Together, we can traverse the landscape of AI, focusing on devising innovative solutions and strategies that can reshape business models and operations.
additional_details_phd: At the doctoral level, I am looking to supervise
  ambitious PhD candidates interested in advancing the field of artificial
  intelligence, focusing on the automation by integrating Large Language Models
  (LLMs), machine learning, and data science. My research delves deep into
  unearthing new methodologies and applications for AI in various scenarios
  beyond business, exploring its impacts, ethical considerations, and
  transformative potentials. PhD students will be at the forefront of generating
  novel insights, developing innovative frameworks, and contributing to the
  scholarly discourse on the evolving landscape of AI. If you are passionate
  about shaping the future of technology and eager to engage in
  multidisciplinary research, I encourage you to reach out, and together, let's
  pioneer the next wave of advancements in AI.
