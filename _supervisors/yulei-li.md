  I strongly focus on several riveting and contemporary fields including Large
  Language Models (LLM), Machine Learning, and Data Science. For undergraduate
  students with a passion for exploring the intersection of technology and
  information, I offer supervision in projects that explore innovative
  applications of AI and Machine Learning in various scenarios, whether it‚Äôs
  developing intelligent systems, creating predictive models, or applying
  algorithms in unprecedented manners.


  If your interests lie in exploring the facets of LLMs and leveraging them to bring about automation and sophisticated solutions in the technology sphere, I would be thrilled to guide you in unfolding the layers of this technology, providing a strong foundation for your future endeavours in academia or industry.


  *HÔªøere are some of my current ideas for Undergraduate Final Year Projects:*


  *Business Process Automation through LLM:*


  Develop a prototype that employs Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT or Llamma 2,  to automate routine business processes and workflows, focusing on areas like customer support or data entry.


  *AI solution in everyday scenarios:*


  Investigate and implement a basic AI solution in an everyday scenario, such as home automation or health monitoring.


  *Time series forecasting using machine learning:*\

  Create a machine learning model to analyse, predict and interpret time series datasets, such as sales.

  Having extensively worked in the domain of Machine Learning and Data Science,
  I am eager to work with postgraduate students interested in deepening their
  understanding and application of these fields. For those inclined towards the
  application of AI and Machine Learning in business and other real-world
  scenarios, there is a myriad of research opportunities ranging from optimising
  business processes, enhancing decision-making, to uncovering patterns in
  consumer behaviour.


  I am particularly interested in supervising projects that not only delve into the theoretical aspects but also emphasize practical, real-world applications, ensuring that the students can contribute meaningfully to the ongoing technological advancements. 


  Here are some of my current ideas for Masters level research topics:


  *The role and impacts of LLM-based automation:*


  To investigate the role and impacts of LLM-based automation in both business world and other fields, such as mental health. 


  *Ethics and implications of Generative AI in automation:*


  To explore the implication of the use of generative AI in automation. 


  *Machine learning for predictive maintenance:*


  Utilise machine learning techniques to predict equipment failure times and maintenance requirements in manufacturing scenarios

  At the doctoral level, I am looking to supervise ambitious PhD candidates
  interested in advancing the field of artificial intelligence, focusing on the
  automation by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs), machine learning, and
  data science. My research delves deep into unearthing new methodologies and
  applications for AI in various scenarios beyond business, exploring its
  impacts, ethical considerations, and transformative potentials. PhD students
  will be at the forefront of generating novel insights, developing innovative
  frameworks, and contributing to the scholarly discourse on the evolving
  landscape of AI. If you are passionate about shaping the future of technology
  and eager to engage in multidisciplinary research, I encourage you to reach
  out, and together, let's pioneer the next wave of advancements in AI.


  Here are some of my current ideas for PhD level research topics:


  *Next-Gen LLMs for Automation:*


  Conduct in-depth research and development of state-of-the-art LLMs to further the field of automation in diverse domains, addressing current limitations and exploring new possibilities.


  *AI-Driven Business Innovation:*


  Develop novel AI-driven strategies and frameworks to drive innovation in business models, processes, and products/services, exploring untapped potentials and applications.
