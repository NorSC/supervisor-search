  I am interested in supervising projects in the areas of machine learning, data
  mining, data analysis for decision support systems/recommender systems. The
  exploratory data analysis can be applied in different areas such as digital
  entrepreneurship, Special Educational Needs (SENs), medical work force
  retention, medical data, online publically available data (e.g., GEM (Global
  Entrepreneurship Monitor), longitudinal household survey - Understanding
  Society and UK census data, and social media). I am also interested in the use
  of digital technologies and entrepreneurship by craft/artisanal businesses,
  for example, potters, jewellers, small scale food and drink producers. The
  research could explore how they combine the contrasting logic of craft and
  modern technology. 


  Please take a look at my publications <http://nrl.northumbria.ac.uk/view/creators/Anwar=3ANaveed=3A=3A.html> for an idea of the kind of work I've done in the past and contact me at Naveed.Anwar@northumbria.ac.uk if you'd like to discuss anything.

  **Data analysis for digital entrepreneurship and well-being of entrepreneurs**


  This age of big data gives a great opportunity to turn large-size datasets with high-velocity and diverse structures into real advantage in many fields, such as health, economics, education and disaster prevention. This research proposal focuses on in-depth analysis of ‘publicly available large datasets’. Digital entrepreneurship is a broad domain and includes businesses predominantly operating online. The data analysis will be performed to explore one of the following aspects of digital entrepreneurship such as online retailers, portals, community sites and also businesses providing services to enable other businesses to operate online, such as web designers, platform providers and operators. This research will also to explore the well-being of these entrepreneurs.  


   


  **Potential Areas of Study**


  We are particularly interested in research in the following areas:


   


  **The quantitative exploration of online entrepreneurship in publicly available large datasets**, for example GEM (Global Entrepreneurship Monitor), longitudinal household survey - Understanding Society and UK census data. 


   


  **Digital entrepreneurship with an explicit link to the developing world**. This could either focus on digital entrepreneurship in developing countries or migrants from developing countries operating in their destination/host country.


   


  **The use of digital technologies and entrepreneurship by craft /artisanal businesses**, for example, potters, jewellers, small scale food and drink producers. The research could explore how they combine the contrasting logics of craft and modern technology.


   


  **Suggested Methodology**


  The final methodology will reflect the detailed research topic, research question and strengths of the student, but it is envisaged that this research will make use of both quantitative and qualitative approach. The main focus will be on quantitative research approach for processing large dataset such as longitudinal household survey - Understanding Society. The qualitative research approach will also be used based on case studies or in-depth interviews with practising entrepreneurs to support the quantitative work.


   


  This project seeks candidates having interest, background and skills in big data/data science and entrepreneurship.
