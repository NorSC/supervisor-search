  data mining, DSS/recommender systems 


  I am interested in supervising projects in the areas of machine learning, data mining, data analysis for decision support systems/recommender systems. The exploratory data analysis can be applied in different areas such as digital entrepreneurship, Special Educational Needs (SENs), medical work force retention, medical data, online publically available data (e.g., GEM (Global Entrepreneurship Monitor), longitudinal household survey - Understanding Society and UK census data, and social media). I am also interested in the use of digital technologies and entrepreneurship by craft/artisanal businesses, for example, potters, jewellers, small scale food and drink producers. The research could explore how they combine the contrasting logic of craft and modern technology. 


  Please take a look at my publications <http://nrl.northumbria.ac.uk/view/creators/Anwar=3ANaveed=3A=3A.html> for an idea of the kind of work I've done in the past and contact me at Naveed.Anwar@northumbria.ac.uk if you'd like to discuss anything.
