  I usually supervise projects which have had web database solutions, with
  recommender systems, social networking and other API
  integration, customisable interfaces or systems for real clients being some of
  the most recent topics. 


  I also have an interest in computational linguistics and have supervised a couple of projects relating to linguistics and computing too.
