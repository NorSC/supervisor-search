  My main research interests are in using technology to enhance education and in
  the intersection of linguistics and computing. I am particularly interested in
  supervising projects which investigate the use of generative AI tools for
  coding.  I also have an interest in collaborative consumption/sharing economy
  models and have supervised students in the past who have developed some
  interesting projects in this area.


  Hï»¿ere are some of my current ideas for Undergraduate Final Year Projects:


  1.  Generative AI Tools for Coding: An Evaluation


  Generative AI and associated tools based on this technology have been developing quickly over the past year.  The implications of using generative AI tools to write code are still to be fully explored in a university setting.  This project would focus on the evaluation of the output of a range of GenAI coding tools in handling a variety of programming problems.  Different perspectives and adaptations could be explored by different students.


  2.  Improving the systems and processes for charitable organisations receiving physical donations


  There are many local initiatives relating to donations of used/new items to charities who pass items to those in need.  Food banks and high street charity shops are the most well-known amongst these.  Many smaller scale community-based charities could benefit from a more systematic approach to receiving donations, managing inventory and getting items to where they are needed.  This project proposes to investigate the issues and design a customised solution to this problem.  This could be approached for different domains by different students.


  I have previously supervised many projects involving real clients to solve bespoke problems, including several which have involved recommender systems.  I would also be interested in supervising students who have an interesting in developing engaging solutions to support learning, such as using gamification.
