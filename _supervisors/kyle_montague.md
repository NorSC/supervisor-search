  You can see some of the active projects (I'm happy to discuss a potential
  project that aligns with any of these):


  * <https://colospeed.uk/> – Digital technologies to support colorectal cancer research

  * <https://enablingongoingness.com/> – Digital/Physical interaction design around end of life and bereavement (IoT/Android/iOS/Wearables)

  * <https://www.digitalcitizens.uk/> – exploring the role of digital technologies with respect to community engagement, democracy, discrimination, politics and action.

  * <https://cue.band/> – wearable technologies to improve the quality of life for people living with Parkinson's Disease. (Android/iOS/Wearables)

  * <https://techandpeople.github.io/wildkey/> – Privacy aware mobile keyboard data collection for research studies. 


  Finally, here are some ideas that I'm currently discussing with my research team in NorSC. All of these projects require a reasonable level of software development and technical skills. 


  ## Playing with AI


  Recent innovations in AI have significantly reduced the challenges and barriers to working with AI models and machine learning techniques. From open source models for classifying or creating images and audio; to the increasingly popular LLMs for text generation and interpretation – there are seemingly endless possibilities and application opportunities. Tinkering, Prototyping and Playing with technologies can be a useful way to discover and showcase their opportunities and limitations; while providing a meaningful way to demonstrate the technical challenges and affordances of these systems. 


  I'm keen to supervise technical projects that are aiming to harness existing AI technologies in playful ways to create interactive prototypes and demonstration pieces that let people play and interact with AI in new ways. 


  **This project will involve software development and working with off-the-shelf AI models / tools / APIs to create rich interactive prototypes. Could be for Web, Mobile or Wearable devices.**




  ## Wearable Devices for People living with Parkinson's Disease


  We have an ongoing project that is exploring the role of wearable technologies to support people living with Parkinson's Disease to manage their condition. Our current study makes use of the Open Source '[PineTime](https://www.pine64.org/pinetime/)' device and custome built smartphone apps (iOS/Android). However, we are keen to expand the work to support existing Apple and Android Smartwatches. 


  **If you are keen to develop apps for Mobiles or Wearable devices, then this would be a suitable project for you.** 




  ## Human-AI Interactions: Design and Creativity


  In recent months we've seen a surge in the innovations surrounding AI tools and frameworks aligned with creative practices - for example [Stable Diffusion](https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release) and [MidJourney](https://www.midjourney.com/home/). These technologies are set to disrupt the design and creative industries; ultimately transforming the ways in which we (i.e. anyone) can design or create. Whilst much of the focus and attention thus far has been on the potential harms of deep fakes, there is an exciting opportunity to harness these technologies for more positive endeavours. I would be keen to support and supervise projects that want to explore the design of interfaces and tools that work with these AI systems to empower and augment everyday interactions of regular people. 


  **If you are keen to work with existing AI models and API to develop new Intelligent Systems and Interfaces, then this would be a suitable project for you.**




  ## The Epidemiology of Web Accessibility


  #### Improving internet health by identifying and tackling the root cause of web accessibility issues


  Today’s web accessibility strategies and tools are predicated on the believe that web accessibility issues are introduced through code created by the website developer, and therefore focus on that website’s code in isolation. However, as demonstrated in modern web securities research, vulnerabilities can be introduced via dependencies to external libraries and frameworks outside of their development control. We are keen to explore research projects that investigate the prevalence of these issues; or software development projects that look to develop new technologies and software to tackle large-scale accessibility issues. 


  Possible projects related to this topic:


  1. Investigating the prevalence of these accessibility vulnerabilities through large-scale analysis of websites using machine learning techniques. (see this paper as background – [Ross et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.1145/3348797)) 

  2. Development and evaluation of an 'Accessibility Vulnerability Database' – either through crowdsourced reporting interfaces; or machine learning and autonomous detection (e.g. github bots)

  3. Exploration of novel interfaces to support detection and repair of accessibility vulnerabilities and wider adoption of these epidemiology inspired approaches and improve overall internet health.

  4. Leveraging AI and Machine Learning tools to fix accessibility issues.




  ## QRcade


  Can we build and play games with QR codes? In recent years we've seen a resurgence in the use of QRcodes for quick access and sharing of information. This project will explore alternative use cases these QRcodes. For example, can we create multiplayer games such as LaserTag using our phones and QRcodes? What about recreating some retro arcade games as large scale interactions for public displays through the power of QRcodes. 


  **This would be a suitable project for someone keen to develop software for Web and Mobile technologies.**

  ## Wearable Devices for People living with Parkinson's Disease


  I'm currently involved in a large-scale deployment of a bespoke wearable device that has been designed to support (PwP) people living with Parkinson's Disease. We will be sending 3000 wearable devices to PwP and having them test and evaluate our designs. As this is an ongoing project there is an opportunity to develop new features and functionality and have that be used by a large population in the wild. We also know from our research that a number of PwP already own Android Wear and iOS Apple Watches – therefore, I'm happy to discuss and supervise projects that will look to design and develop new apps for these wearable devices also.

  ## The Epidemiology of Web Accessibility


  #### Improving internet health by identifying and tackling the root cause of web accessibility issues


  The epidemic of inaccessible websites presents a major challenge to equitable information access and continues to threaten our visions of an inclusive digital society. Strategic and transformational investment across public and private sectors has seen exponential growth in the digital economy and the adoption rate of digital service delivery, which has been further accelerated by recent impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. And yet, despite decades of research, education, legislation, and policy reform globally, little progress has been made to ensure accessibility of websites. Longitudinal analysis of web accessibility improvements revealed that many changes could be attributed to external factors of influence (e.g., Search engine page ranking criteria, and support mobile layouts) ([Richards et al. 2012](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2384916.2384931)) and more recent studies demonstrating that modern websites a continually failing at the most basic level of web accessibility. Moreover, 23-50% of accessibility barriers could be found and addressed by developers using automated tools – suggesting that our current approaches to improving the state of web accessibility are not fit for purpose. Today’s web accessibility strategies and tools are predicated on the believe that web accessibility issues are introduced through code created by the website developer, and therefore focus on that website’s code in isolation. However, as demonstrated in modern web securities research, vulnerabilities can be introduced via dependencies to external libraries and frameworks outside of their development control.

  ## Social Change Technologies


  **Food inequalities:** What are the impacts of Covid-19 and '*pingdemic*' on food security in the UK? Interesting to look at this in relation to socioeconomic indicators. 


   *Available datasets:*


  * The Trussell Trust foodbank locations

  * Asda supermarket’s locations

  * E-food desert index

  * Index of Multiple Deprivations on LSOA level

  * Mystery shopper data from supermarket API on availably and price of [essential food items](https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.trusselltrust.org%2Fget-help%2Femergency-food%2Ffood-parcel%2F&data=04%7C01%7Ckyle.montague%40northumbria.ac.uk%7Cd4b5823b5bdc408ba84308d95c0b149d%7Ce757cfdd1f354457af8f7c9c6b1437e3%7C0%7C0%7C637642024916783228%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=huNroaqAy4sX3oiunt3m0FoGck6Am2PPkfq%2BmjtxuLg%3D&reserved=0) from shops located in IMD decile 1.


  Power M, Doherty B, Pybus K, Pickett K. How COVID-19 has exposed inequalities in the UK food system: The case of UK food and poverty. *Emerald Open Research*. 2020;2:11. Published 2020 May 13. doi:10.35241/emeraldopenres.13539.2 - [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7219559/](https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fpmc%2Farticles%2FPMC7219559%2F&data=04%7C01%7Ckyle.montague%40northumbria.ac.uk%7Cd4b5823b5bdc408ba84308d95c0b149d%7Ce757cfdd1f354457af8f7c9c6b1437e3%7C0%7C0%7C637642024916793181%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=wNtupjJ9R3u8aLEs%2F8lwtYSGEo40q1GlOqUcgD1SoO8%3D&reserved=0)


  **Right to roam:** Right to roam is a law that allows members of the public access certain public or privately owned land, lakes, and rivers for recreation and exercise. With the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 people in England were given freedom to roam on 8% of the land. Last year over 100 authors, musicians, and actors [signed an open letter](https://www.righttoroam.org.uk/letter) to the PM Boris Johnson to call for extending people’s rights to roam.  


  There are also strict rules around wild camping in the UK. Most part of England and Wales it is illegal to wild camp. Although people still wild camp following the rules of arrive late, leave early and leave no trace. However, not all people follow these rules and there have been incidents which have resulted in harsher restrictions - <https://www.northumberlandgazette.co.uk/news/crime/kielder-bans-wild-camping-after-rubbish-dumped-park-2909142>


  How could freedom to roam be extended to enable people responsible enjoy the outdoors and recreational activates? Who can take advantage of this right? What would be solutions for extending the rights, keeping people accountable and helping safeguard nature? What data can be used or collected to explore this?


  **New models of data sharing:** Sharing data usually done via push or pull protocols, using a predefined code, authentication methods and REST API. How can we reimagine data sharing using trigger methods? For example, using “If This, Then That” (IFTTT) channels and to create recipes. What data can be shared using this trigger model? What are benefits and implications for individual and group privacy?
