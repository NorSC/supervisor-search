  ## Virtual Reality areas of interest


  Locomotion: There are many different mechanisms to move around in VR, as these environments grow, we need to explore novel forms of movement and teleportation, walking and even visual tricks to move around.


  Social VR: As VR becomes more social, we create new opportunities for interactions with others; however, the current interfaces are predominantly design for single user interactions. What interactions work well with others? How do we democratise conversation and other essentials of working and being together? How do collective gestures work etc.? 


  Shared Experiences: Collective video watching and live events in VR present an interesting design space for social interactions. What aspects of this physical shared experiences can be captured in VR? and what new affordances does VR offer?


  Social Media: How might we reimagine social media platforms inside Virtual Reality. What do the big players look like when reimagined for more immersive spaces – Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, TikTok. Does this content look like information spaces or is it much closer to home – friendly collegial café environments.


  Bots: How do bots work inside VR? What special affordances or opportunities in VR can we make use of? What don’t we want to see brought over e.g., customer bots?
