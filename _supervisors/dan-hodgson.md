  Tuesdays and Thursdays at 1. I will be in my office at other times, but will
  not be available when teaching. I can also be contacted by email (Teams
  messages are unreliable) and can arrange meetings, either on-campus or through
  Teams.

  I supervise a lot of game-related projects. I have worked a lot with Unreal,
  but have had a lot of projects in Unity and other technologies too. 


  I have strong interest in procedural generation and exploring new techniques for doing so. Projects about difficulty (automated difficulty balancing, AI assessment of difficulty) have been interesting too, I have supervised a good number of VR experience projects, and just a lot of game technology-related projects.


  If you are interested in creating a small game, or porting a tabletop game to computer, then I have several game scenarios I can use. This would suit Software Engineering projects best.


  I have also done a lot of game design investigative projects, usually along the lines of "How does X affect Y" (for example, how does difficulty affect player engagement, how does sound aesthetic affect fear, etc) which involve creating one or (more often) two game experiences to give a direct comparison, which are then playtested with test subjects to get experimental results.


  My current research interests are complex, in the areas of diagrammatical modelling of pen-and-paper RPGs, auto-generating programming script from those diagrams, creating interpreters to run those scripts, and then using this for AI-based difficulty testing and balancing, ultimately heading towards data interoperability and ontological equivalence to automate conversion of player and monster stats between different RPG systems. I would be interesting in supervising any students who want to explore parts of this in detail.

  Iï»¿ have very little knowledge of Deep Learning or Data Science.
