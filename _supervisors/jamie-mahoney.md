  A﻿s well as projects based on the themes and keywords above, I am currently
  interested in exploring and developing projects in the following areas:


  **Understanding the use of visual content on social media** to form and disseminate narratives and information in various contexts, such as politics, sports, or healthcare. This would not only focus on the collection and analysis of relevant data, but how this might be done reliably and effectively, on a larger scale.


  **Understanding the role of social media and digital technologies in politics.** Technologies such as social media platforms will invariably play a role in how many individuals search, find, and are exposed to political content and information. Areas of investigation may include: understanding how individuals perceive these platforms, the extent to which they consciously seek political information online, and how this information influences their political opinions and involvement in political processes.


  **Longitudinal topic modelling** of social media data, tracing when and how certain topics have formed and evolved over time. In doing so, we can identify how topics of discussion have developed from seemingly innocuous topics through to more extreme and problematic topics.


  **S﻿elf disclosure of personal health-based information on social media.** Prior to Covid-19, many people would not necessarily disclose their own health information on social media. However, many people have use social media to share images of their Covid-19 tests (both positive and negative) online. I am interested in identifying how we might retrieve relevant data from online platforms (which may include image analysis to identify which images contain lateral flow tests, for example), and analysing this data to understand the motivations for doing so, and what kinds of information and topics are being shared and discussed as a result.
