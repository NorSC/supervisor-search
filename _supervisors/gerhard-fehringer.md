  I am interested in the following areas:

  Network Performance modelling and testing


  Simulation Performance vs Hardware Performance (eg GNS3)


  Projects utilising Espruino Puck within a Google Home environment


  However, I'd be very happy to discuss your own project ideas - as you will spend a lot of time on your project I prefer if it is something that you really want to do!
