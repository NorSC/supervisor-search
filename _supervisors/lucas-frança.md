  My research interests include Complex Systems, Computational Neuroscience,
  Neuroimaging, Medical signals, and Machine Learning. In the past I supervised
  MSc students on projects leveraging computational methods to elucidate
  questions in physiology and disease processes. \

  \

  I would be willing to supervise projects on the following topics:\

  \

  "**Brain dynamics in early life**" - this project aims to evaluate brain signals EEG/fMRI obtained from newly-borns to model changes in connectivity on the neonatal brain. This will involve applying mathematical and computational methods to the EEG/fMRI signals. You will be expected to use a series of signal processing libraries in Python such as scipy.\

  \

  Example paper (currently in review - preprint available): \

  Lucas G. S. França, Judit Ciarrusta, Oliver Gale-Grant, Sunniva Fenn-Moltu, SeanFitzgibbon, Andrew Chew, Shona Falconer, Ralica Dimitrova, Lucilio Cordero-Grande, Anthony N Price, Emer Hughes, Jonathan O’Muircheartaigh, Eugene Duff, Jetro JTuulari, Gustavo Deco, Serena J Counsell, Joseph V Hajnal, Chiara Nosarti, TomokiArichi, A David Edwards, Grainne McAlonan, Dafnis Batalle


  bioRxiv 2022.11.16.516610; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.11.16.516610\

  \

  "**How to make sense of wearable data**" - this project aims to develop tools and protocols to analyse signals obtained by actigraphy devices (e.g., fitbit). Previous research has shown that activity series are related to a series of health conditions. The goal is to apply mathematical and computational methods to extract information from these signals and model disease processes in a series of conditions ranging from mental health conditions to Parkinson's disease.\

  \

  Example paper:\

  França, L. G. S., Montoya, P., & Miranda, J. G. V. (2019). On multifractals: a non-linear study of actigraphy data. *Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications*, *514*, 612-619. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037843711831255X\

  \

  If you have another project in mind which you think aligns with my scholarly themes, I would be happy to discuss it. Please do get in touch via e-mail.
