  My research interests are in Machine Learning for activity recognition (ML for
  AR) whatever the domain or activity. This involves data capture from sensor
  networks, images and video. I will supervise the following projects: 


  **ML_Project1: Sign Language interpretation:**

  You will investigate and provide a proof of concept using the state of the art in Machine learning techniques for interpreting sign language from images.


  **ML_Project2: Animal recognition and identification:**

  You will investigate and provide a proof of concept using the state of the art in Machine learning techniques for recognition and identification of specific animals in a herd.  


  **ML_Project3: Human pose estimation for sport:**

  Using publicly available data you will investigate and demonstrate the state of the art in Machine learning techniques for analysing human pose in sport. The aim here is to be able to indicate where an athlete can improve posture, position and technique within the range of known ideals.   


  **ML_Project4: FOREX market prediction:**

  Using publicly available data you will investigate and demonstrate the state of the art in time series Machine learning techniques for predicting the direction of currency pairs on the foreign exchange market.  


  **ML_project: Development of an automatic data labelling application:**

  You will develop a software application that will use Machine learning to do object detection that automatically produces bounding boxes for further object detection.
