  Typically, priority is given to UX-focused projects and investigative/general
  games projects. General areas of interest (in no particular order) include:


  * any aspect of visual communication but in particular image seeking behaviour, colour theory and Gestalt principals;

  * mental models, intention, perception and interpretation;

  * interaction design, UX, UID;

  * storytelling and narrative design;

  * role of immersion;

  * persuasive technologies/media;

  * data/information visualisation from a user perspective;

  * information seeking/search and retrieval;

  * information architecture and content management from a user perspective;

  * crime scene reconstructions/aids for witness recall;

  * investigative/general games projects;

  * more broadly, anything with a cognitive slant.


  If you are interested in any of these areas, please get in touch for a chat (lynne.conniss@northumbria.ac.uk) indicating which area you are interested in and any initial project ideas. Thanks.
