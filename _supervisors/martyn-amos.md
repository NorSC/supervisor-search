  **AI solver for puzzle games:** Many simple puzzle games (eg. Sudoku,
  Minesweeper) are easy to describe but very difficult to solve. This project
  will involve the investigation of various algorithmic techniques for the
  automatic solution of such problems, and the development of a program to solve
  examples of a problem of the student's choosing (subject to approval). Please
  note that this project is *not* concerned with developing AI for NPCs; rather,
  it is the creation of AI-based *automatic solvers for puzzle games*. This
  project will be based on our J-POP platform
  (<https://github.com/huwlloyd-mmu/jpop>), which provides a number of solvers
  and puzzle simulators (you can read our overview paper
  [here](https://e-space.mmu.ac.uk/628167/)). Your task will be to choose a new
  puzzle from the hundreds out there, develop a simulator for it, plug it into
  J-POP, and then run experiments to test the various solvers. Note that this is
  all written in C++, so you will need to be a competent/confident programmer in
  this language.


  **Artificial life**: Artificial Life (a-life) is an exciting research area at the intersections of computer science, biology, economics, engineering, mathematics, and other disciplines. Fundamentally, a-life researchers use computational methods to study "life as it could be" - that is, we use models and simulations to help us understand systems as diverse as ant colonies, economies and populations of bacterial cells. For this project, you will select an area of interest to you (in consultation with me), and then investigate it using computational methods such as agent-based simulation. This is quite a broad topic area, and it's suitable for a wide range of systems, including (for example) crowds of people. There also exist excellent libraries and model-building tools, so you will not have to build everything from scratch; see Netlogo (<https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/>) for one example, which contains a huge number of example projects.


  **Block-based mobile game**: This project involves implementing a block-based puzzle game, according to a given specification. The game I have in mind is based on one I wrote for the Acorn Electron, way back in the mists of time (1986!) It was called Peabody, and I think it still contains a number of original features... It should be implemented on a mobile platform, if possible. The project will require good programming skills, and ideally some competence with graphics. Again, there are a ton of libraries out there that you can use - the emphasis is getting the game logic and playability right.


  **Ant colony optimisation**: The behaviour of ant colonies when foraging for food, tending their brood, and dividing up tasks amongst colony members has recently been abstracted in computational terms and successfully applied to a whole range of important problems (such as routing data packets through a mobile telephone network that is sensitive to equipment failure). These “ant algorithms” form a new class of nature-inspired solutions that are becoming increasingly popular in science and industry. This project would involve choosing a problem (either from the literature or after discussion with myself and/or external partners), generating an ant-based solution, and then comparing its performance against existing alternative algorithms. 


  **Swarm-based computation**: The ability of social insects to collectively solve problems has been well-studied and documented. The behaviour of foraging ants, for example, has been abstracted to provide algorithmic solutions that are robust, distributed, and flexible. The particular behaviour that we will focus on is the *clustering* or *sorting* of ant corpses or larvae. Abstract models of these behaviours have been successfully applied to, amongst other problems, numerical data analysis, data mining, and graph partitioning. In this project, we focus on the task of *brood sorting*, which is essentially a problem of distributed computation; how can can a number of simple agents, with minimal communication, take a collection of objects and arrange them into a spatially coherent desired structure? This problem will find important applications in (for example) swarm robotics. For background, [please refer to the original paper we wrote on this subject](http://www.martynamos.org/Docs/1245.pdf); this project will first involve re-implementing the basic algorithm in a language of choice, and then investigating new aspects of its behaviour.
