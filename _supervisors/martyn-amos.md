  AI solver for puzzle games: Many simple puzzle games (eg. Sudoku, Minesweeper)
  are easy to describe but very difficult to solve. This project will involve
  the investigation of various algorithmic techniques for the automatic solution
  of such problems, and the development of a program to solve examples of a
  problem of the student's choosing (subject to approval). Such techniques may
  include genetic algorithms or ant colony optimization. Please note that this
  project is not concerned with developing AI for Non-Player Characters; rather,
  it is the creation of AI-based automatic solvers for puzzle games. This
  project will be based on our J-POP platform:

  Artificial life: Artificial Life (a-life) is an exciting research area at the intersections of computer science, biology, economics, engineering, mathematics, and other disciplines. Fundamentally, a-life researchers use computational methods to study "life as it could be" - that is, we use models and simulations to help us understand systems as diverse as ant colonies, economies and populations of bacterial cells. For this project, you will select an area of interest to you (in consultation with me), and then investigate it using computational methods such as agent-based simulation.


  Block-Based Mobile Game: This project involves implementing a block-based puzzle game, according to a given specification. The game I have in mind is based on one I wrote for the Acorn Electron, way back in the mists of time (1986!) It should be implemented on a mobile platform, if possible. The project will require good programming skills.
