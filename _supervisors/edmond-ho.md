  Some examples:\

  \

  **1. Analyzing Body Movements for Cerebral Palsy Prediction**\

  *The pursuit of early diagnosis of cerebral palsy has been an active research area with some very promising results using tools such as the General Movements Assessment (GMA). In this project, we explore the feasibility of extracting pose-based features from video sequences to automatically classify infant body movement into two categories, normal and abnormal. The classification was based upon the GMA, which was carried out on the video data by an independent expert reviewer.*




  **2. Human Motion Analysis for Healthcare Applications**\

  *Using skeletal data for human motion analysis has several advantages over the other visual data such as video and images since the features extracted from skeletal data tend to be more compact and more robust to the variation between different subjects as the visual appearance is not included. In \[Rueangsirarak et al. IEEE TNSRE2018], we propose an automatic framework for classifying musculoskeletal and neurological disorders among older people based on 3D motion data. To handle noisy skeletal data captured using depth sensors such as Microsoft Kinect, we propose a framework that accurately classifies the nature of the 3D postures obtained by Kinect using a max-margin classifier in \[Ho et al. CVIU2016].*




  **3. Emotion Analysis and Transfer for Facial Expressions and Body Movements**\

  *Emotion is considered to be a core element in performances. In computer animation, both body motions and facial expressions are two popular mediums for a character to express emotion. However, there has been limited research in studying how to effectively synthesize these two types of character movements using different levels of emotion strength with intuitive control, which is difficult to be modelled effectively. In this project, we explore a common model \[Chan et al. CAVW2019] that can be used to represent emotion for the applications of body motions \[Ho et al. D2AT2017] and facial expressions \[Stef et al. SKIMA2018] synthesis.*
