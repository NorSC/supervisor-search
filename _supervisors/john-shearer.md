  I'm a polyglot, full-stack programmer with experience from embedded processors
  to the cloud, along with expertise in Computer Graphics, Games and HCI.
  Professionally, I'm focused on helping build happy, productive teams, using
  modern software development and leadership practices (Agile, DevOps, TDD and
  IaaC), especially in data-heavy or data-complex environments. My research
  interests are wide, but particularly include interactions in unusual spaces or
  through alternative modalities.


  Some of my recent (industry) work includes:

  * Reverse Engineering undocumented file formats (Python)

  * Data Engineering - architecting and building a replacement dataflow processor (100GB+/day) (Python,AWS)

  * Virtual Reality for CAD visualisation (C#/.Net, Python)

  * Ground-breaking 3D printing slicer (C++, Node/JS)


  Below are a sampling of some project ideas. I'm happy to discuss those specific projects, or projects that you come up with that are similar. 


  ## Some project ideas


  ### Ferret game on mobile


  Ferret is a real-world, coin-based, table game (https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/151846/ferret). 


  This project would implement and evaluate Ferret as a touchscreen app.


  ### Water management game


  Simulation of (simple) water flow affords a variety of interesting game mechanics

  surrounding water management. These could include canal/river management, flood-related games.


  This project would design, build and evaluate a game using water simulation and associated game mechanics. There is significant scope for interesting/novel game design, but the DEVELOPMENT of the artefact is a key (majority) component - i.e. this is NOT a game design project.

  Note: this project could be re-imagined in a variety of interesting ways (e.g. lava-flow).


  ### Magnetism Simulation


  No major physics engine have any magnetism simulation. Allowing games with magnetism

  simulation may afford new game mechanics.


  This project will add Magnetism Simulation to an open source physics engine, or implement Magnetism as a stand-alone component within an experimental game.


  ### LiveQR


  There are a variety of contexts, especially in public-display contexts, where being confident that a user in actually physically located with the display is important (e.g. games, attendance system).


  This project will explore using rapidly changing QR codes to "authenticate" that a

  phone/device is viewing a QR code live. This approach will always be somewhat by-passable, but the project will include some evaluation of the "strength" of the authentication.


  ### Games that you load like retro games


  In the 1980s and 1990s loading games was significantly more involved than it is now,

  involving things such as loading from a tape, switching a tape mid-game, customization of the boot sequence (autoexec.bat).


  This project will build physical computing devices to provide experiences to modern users of the game loading (and similar) experiences of yesteryear. For example, loading a game from a (perhaps simulated) tape drive.


  ### Git plugin for Zip Files


  Many people knowingly or otherwise use zip files for important files that would benefit from being versioned/diff’ed. Specifically, most of the open document formats (e.g. .docx) are just normal zip files, with special contents.


  This project will build an open source git plugin to support effective versioning of zip files. This will most likely be through automatically extracted zip files to folder at add/commit-time, and rezipping them when appropriate.


  ### Code Auralizer


  When writing, debugging, or running code it is useful to be able to have an  understanding of the internal state of the software, and changes thereof.


  This project of is focussed on presenting that internal state (and/or changes to it) as sound. This would allow developer to have a real-time, background, non-interferring sense of the situation. For a concrete example, presently when you run a project in Visual Studio a graph of RAM usage is shown on screen. This is could be "displayed" aurally allowing a developer to hear what’s going on without needing their visual attention. This is especially relevant to Games Development and other real-time work.


  ### Public Space Movement Game


  Public space games allow people to play games in public spaces, frequently on large displays. Using standard controllers/interfaces for this can be problematic or obstructive. One type of interesting public space games are those with multiple individuals working together in a group to control a game character - either against an NPC or against another group.


  This project will develop one or more simple games that can be controlled by groups of people in public space. One example is a simple two playing racing game where the steering is controlled by Optical Flow calculations on the two halves of an image of a room (i.e. on each half of the room).
