  **A﻿dditional Themes:**  Music Technologies, Theatre Technologies, Digital
  Pedagogies


  My main research interests are in using digital technology in education, specifically to support teachers to enact creative and collaborative ways of teaching.  I am also interested in exploring how we can design and develop collaborative technologies at the intersection of Human Computer Interaction and the Performing Arts.  Throughout all my research I use participatory design research methods to try and design and develop technologies that people want to embed into their practices.


  **Creating Tangible Music Education Resources**


  STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Maths) Education aims to understand the opportunities for integrating the arts into STEM subjects.  This project would draw on the use of STEAM to create a set of materials for schools that support them to teach students how to explore music through creating some basic digital instruments using micro:bits.  The project would include creating some basic instruments as an example and a set of materials that teachers can use to help support students to create their own.

  **Participatory Stage Lighting**


  Stage lighting is traditionally designed by one lighting designer and fixed prior to a show, however there are lots of creative possibilities to enhance this process.  This project would use Open Lighting Architecture (<https://www.openlighting.org/ola/>) to explore the possibility of collaborative stage lighting, where the audience or the actors on stage can alter the lighting.

  **Women in Music Technology**


  Women remain hugely underrepresented in all aspects of music technology, both in education as well as in the industry.  This project would explore both the actual and perceived barriers that exist for women and design and design a tool aimed at supporting women to engage in music technology education.

  There are some current MSc level research topics that I would be interested in supervising:


  ***Co-Designing Collaborative Support Tools***


  Collaborative learning is thought to offer many benefits including ensuring active learning, as well as improving problem solving and critical thinking skills.  Supporting effective collaboration however can be challenging.  This research study would use co-design to understand what students find challenging about collaborative projects and design a digital tool that can support collaboration.

  ***Co-Designing an Automated Feedback Tool***


  Feedback is really important for supporting learning, however it can be challenging to ensure all students get high quality and detailed feedback quickly.  Automated feedback tools have been shown to be effective in subjects such as maths where it is clear what the ‘right’ answer is.  This research study would use co-design methods to understand what kind of feedback students need when they are working on creative or collaborative projects and design an automated feedback tool that might be effective in this context.

  ***Investigating the existence of Digital Natives***


  Digital Natives is a concept that has seen much interest since its inception with conflicting evidence about their existence and what that means for teaching and learning.  This research study would use interview and observational methods to explore whether our understanding of digital natives needs to be updated.  It would interview postgraduate computing students to explore their understanding and competencies with the use of a variety of digital technologies.
