  I would like to see any projects that are relevant to deep learning, AI in
  games, and probabilistic model checking. 


  P﻿ossible project topics could be: 


  1﻿. Adapt different deep learning models or machine learning algorithms for energy prediction. 


  2﻿. Improve the performance of the deep learning models by different optimization algorithms


  3﻿. Adapt AI algorithms to computer games, such as path-finding, flocking, and decision making. Or investigate the performance of different AI algorithms. 


  4﻿. Build  Probabilistic models, such as Markov Chain and Markov decision Process models for probabilistic software and hardware systems. Apply probablistic model checking algorithms to the built model to check the stochastic properties, such as PCTL. 


  5﻿. Adapt machine learning algorithms to learn models for model checking, especially for probabilistic model checking.
