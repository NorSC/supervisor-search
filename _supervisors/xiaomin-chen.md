  The BSc project ideas I'm interested in include:


  **1 Privacy and Untraceability in digital payment systems**


  **K﻿eywords: Privacy, Cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, Blind Signature**


  Mobile payment systems enable smartphone users to pay for a product/service without using physical cards or cash. Privacy violation can take place either on the mobile device, or even worse, on the Service Provider side. To protect user privacy against the third-party Service Provider (e.g. Amazon), researchers have started to design "untraceable" payment systems using cryptography techniques, such as bitcoin, blind signature. Untraceable payment systems can guarantee fair and secure transactions between customers and merchants without exposing the linkage to the Service Provider. 


  We have proposed such a system and are planning to build a prototype for it. If you're interested in data privacy and cryptography, and good at programming in Java,  we would like you to join in this project. 


  **2 Privacy in recommendation systems**


  **K﻿eywords: Privacy, Differential Privacy, Federated Learning, Recommender Algorithm**


  Recommendation systems play a key role in today's e-commerce platforms. Recommendations are performed by analysing users' purchase historic data and personal profiles. It has been revealed that the service providers collect more data than required.  Even ethical data aggregation and analytics can violate user privacy. In this project students will investigate state-of-the-art privacy-preserving measures, such as differential learning, federated learning, and deep-learning recommendation algorithms, and develop a prototype for a private recommendation system. Knowledge in machine learning/deep learning and programming in python are essential. such as differential learning, federated learning, 


  **3 IoT Protocol design and simulation using Network Simulators**


  Design/modify network protocols to solve existing issues in current IoT networks. The protocols need to be implemented in a research network simulator, e.g. OMNeT++, NS3. Experiments need to be run to show the performance improvement. Programming in C++ is required. 


  **4 Security and Privacy in IoT environment**


  The deployment of IoT infrastructure has imposed many security and privacy risks in our daily lives. For example, data collected through smart meters can be used to predict your personal life pattern and even more private information. IoT end devices or the entire network have become the new targets of cyber attacks. If you're interested in this area, either on the security or the privacy, you're welcome to discuss project ideas with me.
