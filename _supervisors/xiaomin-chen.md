  The BSc project ideas I'm interested in include:


  **1 Privacy and Untraceability in Digital Payment Systems**


  **K﻿eywords: Privacy, Cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, Blind Signature**


  Mobile payment systems enable smartphone users to pay for a product/service without using physical cards or cash. Privacy violation can take place either on the mobile device, or even worse, on the Service Provider side. To protect user privacy against the third-party Service Provider (e.g. Amazon), researchers have started to design "untraceable" payment systems using cryptography techniques, such as bitcoin, blind signature. Untraceable payment systems can guarantee fair and secure transactions between customers and merchants without exposing the linkage to the Service Provider. 


  We have proposed such a system and are planning to build a prototype for it. If you're interested in data privacy and cryptography, and good at programming in Java,  we would like you to join in this project. 


  **2 Privacy in Recommendation Systems**


  **K﻿eywords: Privacy, Differential Privacy, Federated Learning, Recommender Algorithm**


  Recommendation systems play a key role in today's e-commerce platforms. Recommendations are performed by analysing users' purchase historic data and personal profiles. It has been revealed that the service providers collect more data than required.  Even ethical data aggregation and analytics can violate user privacy. In this project students will investigate state-of-the-art privacy-preserving measures, such as differential learning, federated learning, and deep-learning recommendation algorithms, and develop a prototype for a private recommendation system. Knowledge in machine learning/deep learning and programming in python are essential. such as differential learning, federated learning, 


  **3 Privacy in Digital Healthcare**


  **4 Preserving Privacy when Fighting against Finance Crimes**


  **K﻿eywords: Privacy, Money Laundering, Federated Learning, Finance Crimes**


  Investigation into finance crimes such as corruptions, money laundering, requests a full access to individual bank accounts including personal data and historic transaction data. What price should anti-financial crimes put on people's privacy rights? This question has become unavoidable for all involved in the fight. We need to strike a balance between the effective extraction of information to expose criminal activities and the responsible use of personal data.


  In this project, we will explore privacy preserving solutions that are capable of training anomaly detection models given the datasets, while providing a demonstrable level of privacy protection against well-known privacy violation attacks. Students who have machine learning background and are especially interested in Anti-Money Laundering models are welcome to join this project.
