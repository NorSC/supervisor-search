  **Additional Themes**: Digital play, game design, inclusive play, playful
  learning, games and learning, mixed-reality games, Higher Education


  My main research interests are in using playful approaches and digital games to support adult learning, as well as impacts on work, social engagement and wellbeing. I am particularly interested in the potential of games and play to support learning, but also how they can unintentionally create barriers to engagement. More widely, I am interested in digital learning and digital practice in Higher Education. 


  I use mixed-method and participatory research designs and am interested in supporting projects in the following areas:


  * the design of educational games to meet learning outcomes or engagement objectives;

  * explorations of player experience and game experience design;

  * social justice, inclusivity and gaming;

  * the use of technology in adult education; 

  * educational escape game design. 


  I am very happy to discuss any projects in these, or related areas.
