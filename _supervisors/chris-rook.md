  I can be found in Ellison B119 from Tuesdays to Fridays. My drop-in times are
  Tuesdays 11am and Fridays 1pm. You are welcome to knock on the door at other
  times, but I may not be available.

  To discuss project ideas, I will also be in the Games Lab (CIS 102) from 2:30pm to 3:30pm on Wednesday 28th September. No need to email in advance - just turn up and share your ideas. (If you can't make that time, use the Tuesday drop-in or email me.)

  I can supervise a wide range of projects in the computing field, but usually supervise students on the Computer Science with Game BSc, on projects relating to games development. If you are short of project ideas and want some suggestions, please email me.


  I﻿ have some specific ideas, listed below:


  **S﻿tory stem puppet show -** A "story stem" is used by psychologists and social workers to engage with children. It starts by giving the child the beginning of a story and the child finishes it off, using creative writing, drawing or simply speaking. The project is to make a computer-equivalent (using Unreal or Unity or similar) where the child can build a sort of puppet show, where characters follow scripted events set by the child. Note this project will not involve working directly with children.


  **S﻿hell engine update** - I have a simple 2d game "engine" that can be improved in various ways. (There are lots of options, so you can choose what interests you.) You would need to be able to work with C++, so either already have C++ experience or are confident with Java or C#. 


  **M﻿obile app gamification** - We have a mobile application designed to encourage users to engage with various wellbeing activities. Your part of the project would be to create gamification elements to support the rest of the tool. There are already some good ideas for how to do this, which we would need to discuss in person. You would need to have some experience of android development, or at least be keen to learn.


  "﻿I want to make a game" is a really bad idea for a project. There are two reasons. First, the ideas come from your head, which makes it very hard to explore requirements, and also to evaluate, which are both hugely important parts of the project. Second, a game has many components and you will have to do them all very briefly, which prevents you from demonstrating excellence. It is very possible to do a game-related project, but usually on some specific aspect of a game, or something small for a specific purpose.
