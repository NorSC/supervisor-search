  I can supervise a wide range of projects in the computing field, but usually supervise students on the Computer Science with Game BSc, on projects relating to games development. I am also involved in research relating to the use of games/computers for mental wellbeing, and have a number of ready-to-go project ideas in this area.


  I have a few other smaller interests which might be relevant if you have a specific project in that area: Reynolds behaviours, ant algorithms, TLA+, comparative programming languages, computing history, emulation.


  I﻿ have some specific ideas, listed below:


  **Virtual puppet show -** This is a project suitable for students with experience in Unreal (or perhaps Unity or similar). The aim is to construct a world (probably 2.5D) with a few characters that can move around and produce speech bubbles using a script. The plan is for this to be suitable as a creative activity for children in care, but the project will not involve working with children. I have access to various social work specialists who can advise and/or act as a client.


  **Heart Garden -** This is a project suitable for students with experience in Unreal. We have a prototype of an Unreal program that displays a garden that responds to heart rate data from a sensor. This can be developed in various directions, but one key goal is to make the garden look nicer. This could be converted to a VR program, for example, or we have some plans to turn it into a game.


  **Biometric sensor data -** We currently have a program that uses data from a cheap heart sensor. We would like to find ways to connect to other sensors (such as a fitbit or polar sensor) as well as perhaps other types of sensor, such as a galvanic skin reponse tool. This is suitable for a student who wants to work with sensor devices and can solve problems. No specific programming language is expected - you can use whatever you are comfortable with, or learn a new one as part of the project.


  **Environment design**- We have an Unreal project that includes an environment that need to be expanded, with some interactive elements. I know that's a bit vague - contact me to discuss it. This is suitable for a student interested in level design with artistic/aesthetic skills.


  **Heart game -** Similar to the Heart Garden project above, we have some interest from clients in a game in which your heart rate is a factor in the game itself. We have some ideas for the design of the game, so I suggest you discuss that with me. There is still considerable scope to adjust the design, though.


  "﻿I want to make a game" is a really bad idea for a project. There are two reasons. First, the ideas come from your head, which makes it very hard to explore requirements, and also to evaluate. These are both hugely important parts of the project. Second, a game has many components and you will have to do them all very briefly, which prevents you from demonstrating excellence. It is very possible to do a game-related project, but usually on some specific aspect of a game, or something small for a specific purpose.

  I am interested in hearing about any project relating to computer games. I am interested in the use of games technology to help education and social care. I am also involved in research relating to the use of games/computers for mental wellbeing, and have a number of ready-to-go project ideas in this area.


  I have a few other smaller interests which might be relevant if you have a specific project in that area: Reynolds behaviours, ant algorithms, TLA+, comparative programming languages, computing history, emulation.


  Note that I am not particularly interested in projects on machine learning, security, or data science. There are several other supervisors with interest in these fields. The same applies to web sites, unless there is a clear game/education element to it.
