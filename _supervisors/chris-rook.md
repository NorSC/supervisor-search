  I can supervise a wide range of projects in the computing field, but usually supervise students on the Computer Science with Game BSc, on projects relating to games development. If you are short of project ideas and want some suggestions, please email me.


  I﻿ have some specific ideas, listed below:


  **S﻿tory stem puppet show -** A "story stem" is used by psychologists and social workers to engage with children. It starts by giving the child the beginning of a story and the child finishes it off, using creative writing, drawing or simply speaking. The project is to make a computer-equivalent (using Unreal or Unity or similar) where the child can build a sort of puppet show, where characters follow scripted events set by the child. Note this project will not involve working directly with children.


  **S﻿hell engine update** - I have a simple 2d game "engine" that can be improved in various ways. (There are lots of options, so you can choose what interests you.) You would need to be able to work with C++, so either already have C++ experience or are confident with Java or C#. 


  **M﻿obile app gamification** - We have a mobile application designed to encourage users to engage with various wellbeing activities. Your part of the project would be to create gamification elements to support the rest of the tool. There are already some good ideas for how to do this, which we would need to discuss in person. You would need to have some experience of android development, or at least be keen to learn.
