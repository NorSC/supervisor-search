  I can supervise a wide range of projects in the computing field, but usually supervise students on the Computer Science with Game BSc, on projects relating to games development. I am also involved in research relating to the use of games/computers for mental wellbeing, and have a number of ready-to-go project ideas in this area.


  I have a few other smaller interests which might be relevant if you have a specific project in that area: Reynolds behaviours, ant algorithms, TLA+, comparative programming languages, computing history, emulation.


  I﻿ have some specific ideas, listed below:


  **S﻿tory stem puppet show -** A "story stem" is used by psychologists and social workers to engage with children. It starts by giving the child the beginning of a story and the child finishes it off, using creative writing, drawing or simply speaking. The project is to make a computer-equivalent (using Unreal or Unity or similar) where the child can build a sort of puppet show, where characters follow scripted events set by the child. Note this project will not involve working directly with children.


  **M﻿obile app gamification** - We have a mobile application designed to encourage users to engage with various wellbeing activities. Your part of the project would be to create gamification elements to support the rest of the tool. There are already some good ideas for how to do this, which we would need to discuss in person. You would need to have some experience of android development, or at least be keen to learn.


  "﻿I want to make a game" is a really bad idea for a project. There are two reasons. First, the ideas come from your head, which makes it very hard to explore requirements, and also to evaluate. These are both hugely important parts of the project. Second, a game has many components and you will have to do them all very briefly, which prevents you from demonstrating excellence. It is very possible to do a game-related project, but usually on some specific aspect of a game, or something small for a specific purpose.

  I am interested in hearing about any project relating to computer games. I am interested in the use of games technology to help education. I am also involved in research relating to the use of games/computers for mental wellbeing, and have a number of ready-to-go project ideas in this area.



  I have a few other smaller interests which might be relevant if you have a specific project in that area: Reynolds behaviours, ant algorithms, TLA+, comparative programming languages, computing history, emulation.



  Note that I am not particularly interested in projects on machine learning, security, or data science. There are several other supervisors with interest in these fields.
