office_hours: >
  I work full time. I have three drop in hours per week where students can just
  drop in to see me. These are Thursdays 13:00-15:00 and Fridays
  12:30-13:30.  If you would like a specific time during this period, just
  contact me via email to book an appointment.


  My office is ELB206 on the second floor of B Block, Ellison Building and my work phone no is 0191 243 7697.

  **Additional Themes**: Application of AI and Machine Learning for health and
  engineering


  You may bring your own idea or get an idea from me to adapt or innovate AI approaches to various applications, such as healthcare, computer vision, robotics, engineering, cybersecurity, forensics etc. You are particularly welcome if you'd like to take a challenging project in these areas.


  If you do not have a good idea yet, I would then encourage you to take my 'live' projects based on the scenarios provided by industry partners. The industry projects are great opportunities for first-hand real-world working experience, and multiple students secured their first jobs or based on their impressive performance on their computing projects.


  H﻿ere are some of my current ideas for Undergarduate Final Year Proejcts:


  **1﻿. Automatic seabed boluder picking using Machine Learning appraoches**


  Offshore wind farm produces renewable energy and has fewer effects on the environment than many other energy sources. Boulders and complex conditions must be detected and analysed before wind farm deployment. This project aims to apply the advances of Computer Vision to detect boulders to support wind turbine caballing.


  **2.	Automatic wind Turbine caballing using Machine Learning approaches**


  Offshore wind farm produces renewable energy and has fewer effects on the environment than many other energy sources. A key step of offshore wind farm development is the connection of wind turbines to a power station in the farm, which is then connected to the national grid to finally deliver clean energy to consumers. This proejct aims to develop AI approaches for automatic cabling.


  **3.	Occupational Health Support using Artificial Intelligence**


  Occupational health has become a prime concern for many organisations for optimal staff wellbeing and employee productivity. This project aims to develop AI technologies for occupational data analysis to provide recommendations for better wellbeing.
