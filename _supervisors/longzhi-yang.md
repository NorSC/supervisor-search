  Hi, 


  Hope you are well. You are welcome to contact me for your final year projects. 


  You may bring your own idea or get an idea from me to adapt or innovate AI approaches to various applications, such as healthcare, computer vision, robotics, engineering, cybersecurity, forensics etc. You are particularly welcome if you'd like to take a challenging project in these areas and I have supported multiple UG graduates publishing their findings and get full PhD scholarships from multiple universities, including Russel Group Universities such as University or York and Newcastle University. 


  If you do not have a good idea yet, I would then encourage you to take my 'live' projects based on the scenarios provided by industry partners. The industry projects are great opportunities for first-hand real-world working experience, and multiple students secured their first jobs based on their impressive performance on their computing projects.


  Best regards,


  Longzhi

  Hi, 


  Hope you are well. You are very welcome to contact me for PhD projects in the area of Artificial Intelligence (AI), machine learning, and their applications. 


  You may bring your own idea or get an idea from me to develop new or advance existing AI/machine learning approaches, and innovatively apply them to various applications, such as healthcare, computer vision, robotics, engineering, cybersecurity, forensics etc. You are particularly welcome to take a theorectical development project, which can usually lead to top conference and journal publications.


  If you do not have a good idea yet, I would then encourage you to take my 'live' projects based on the challenges provided by my industry partners. The industry projects are great opportunities for impactful research experience as these projects will usually drive changes in the industry. In addition, the real-world working experience directly collaborating with industry is particularly fond by the industry for post-doctoral jobs.


  Best regards,


  Longzhi
