  \r

  I am happy to discuss any project ideas in the broader domain of networks.\r

  Some project ideas to get you thinking:\r

  \r

  1.\tSecure and reliable unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) communication \r

  The idea is to look at different security aspects for UAV communications and
  explore the utilisation of blockchain, intrusion prevention and other
  techniques for making the UAV communications secure. The analysis will be
  expanded to evaluate different techniques and proposing a secure UAV
  communication mechanism.\r

  Tools that can be employed for analysis include Network Simulator 3 (Ns3) or
  Matlab.\r

  2.\tGames for Health and Environment(e.g. for children with cerebral
  palsy)/or Using Machine learning for optimising games\r

  The idea is to develop games that can be utilised by special children with
  any balance disabilities. The game development will require the development of
  the graphical user interface along with it’s integration with a hardware
  balance board through . Please see this
  link(https://gordon.johnson7.co.uk/project.php?project=8)) as an example.\r

  \r

  Another idea is to develop a game that allows people to do certain chores
  related to saving the environment in a city or a neighbourhood. The idea is to
  develop a very basic game where the users can do activities such as recycling,
  disposing garbage, efficient water utilisation. The game can be points based
  where different points are awarded for different activities. We can discuss
  this idea further.\r

  3.\tRFduino based smart home system controlled by an Android Application\r

  RFduino is a microcontroller that is easily available and it can be
  programmed to perform several tasks. Our aim would be to utilise the Bluetooth
  connectivity of RFduino and control it through the Android Application on our
  phones. Through the android application, you will be able to control different
  things at home for example switching the lights on and off, managing the locks
  and many other things. We can think of different applications such as opening
  car locks etc. This project will require\r

  •\tHardware: RFdunio with bluetooth wireless link, wires, breadboard\r

  •\tSoftware: Android application development\r

  4.\tTraining underwater swarm Robots using Machine Learning/Reinforcement
  learning\r

  This will be a simulation-based project where underwater robots will be
  simulated and their path prediction will be done through Machine Learning
  tools. The idea is to leave these robots underwater to collect the required
  information e.g. graphics, temperature etc and then predict any parameters
  such as the movement of fish, environment monitoring etc. This is just an
  example, you can come up with fresh ideas as to how underwater robots can help
  in protecting the ecosystem.\r\n"
