  I am happy to discuss any project ideas in the broader domain of networks.

  Some project ideas to get you thinking:


  1. Secure and reliable unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) communication 
     The idea is to look at different security aspects for UAV communications and explore the utilisation of blockchain, intrusion prevention and other techniques for making the UAV communications secure. The analysis will be expanded to evaluate different techniques and proposing a secure UAV communication mechanism.
     Tools that can be employed for analysis include Network Simulator 3 (Ns3) or Matlab.
  2. Games for Health and Environment(e.g. for children with cerebral palsy)/or Using Machine learning for optimising games
     The idea is to develop games that can be utilised by special children with any balance disabilities. The game development will require the development of the graphical user interface along with itâ€™s integration with a hardware balance board through . Please see this link(https://gordon.johnson7.co.uk/project.php?project=8)) as an example.

  Another idea is to develop a game that allows people to do certain chores related to saving the environment in a city or a neighbourhood. The idea is to develop a very basic game where the users can do activities such as recycling, disposing garbage, efficient water utilisation. The game can be points based where different points are awarded for different activities. We can discuss this idea further.


  3. Training underwater swarm Robots using Machine Learning/Reinforcement learning
     This will be a simulation-based project where underwater robots will be simulated and their path prediction will be done through Machine Learning tools. The idea is to leave these robots underwater to collect the required information e.g. graphics, temperature etc and then predict any parameters such as the movement of fish, environment monitoring etc. This is just an example, you can come up with fresh ideas as to how underwater robots can help in protecting the ecosystem.
