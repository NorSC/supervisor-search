  I work on Natural Language Processing systems more particularly on Sentiment
  Analysis to extract/understrand opinions and sentiments from tweets and
  text-based feedback on social media for different purposes.


  Here are some examples of projects/topics I'm working on : 


  \- Analyse tweets to extract e-customers feeback/statisfaction in e-commerce (e-commerce)


  \- Detect psychological disorders (e.g. postpartum depression) on social media by analysing posts, tweets, etc (healthcare)


  \- Analyse users' feedback on brands, services and/or products to assess the trustworthiness and reputation of the related services (e-business)


  I'd more than happy to discuss any related topic, carefully listen to your ideas and thoughts to come up with brilliant ideas for your individual computing project together.


  All the best,


  Hasnae
