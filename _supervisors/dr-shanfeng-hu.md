  I’m running the **Why Lab** at Northumbria University to work on public &
  cooperate & personalized policymaking. The theme of our research is combining
  empirical knowledge, digital twin simulation, causal reasoning, machine
  learning, and game theory to seek fair and high-quality decision-making for
  both localized and wider domains of practical applications. Our research is
  motivated by and rooted in real-world processes, including but not limited to:
  low-carbon policy, smart manufacturing (supply chain, predictive maintenance),
  additive manufacturing, healthcare systems, education technologies. We strive
  for real impacts and drive socio-economic value creation through our research
  findings. The Lab’s fundings and publications are, as a result, centered
  around these goals and as always, we welcome collaborations and new
  opportunities to innovate.


  Topics include but are not limited to:


  \- *Smart Manufacturing* (supply chain, predictive maintenance, dental health products)


  \- *Healthcare Systems* (community care services, personalized medicines, digital health management)


  \- *Climate Change* (low-carbon policymaking, environmental disruptions, natural disater prediction)


  \- *Epidemiology* (pathogen forecast, vaccine takeup, biological causal networks)


  \- *Artificial Intelligence* (causal reasoning, machine learning, deep learning, lifelong learning)
