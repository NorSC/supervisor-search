  I’m keen to supervise projects that you are passionate about. If you’ve got an
  idea and looks like I’ve got relevant experience and interests, then get in
  touch.


  My research interests are machine learning and its various applications, such as behaviour analysis, wearable, and ubiquitous computing, etc. I am interested in developing practical artificial intelligence tools to solve the challenges of real-world applications. In essence, it is to model the practical problems using mathematical languages and develop machine learning algorithms for the optimal solution, bridging the gap between signal/data and human-understandable knowledge.


  ### **Sleep Stage Classification using Wearable Sensing Data**


  The gold standard for clinical sleep monitoring is polysomnography(PSG), based on which sleep can be categorized into five stages, including wake/rapid eye movement sleep (REM sleep)/Non-REM sleep 1 (N1)/Non-REM sleep 2 (N2)/Non-REM sleep 3 (N3). However, PSG is expensive, burdensome, and not suitable for daily use. For long-term sleep monitoring, ubiquitous sensing may be a solution.


  Most recently, cardiac sensing has become popular in classifying three-stage sleep since this modality can be easily acquired from research-grade or consumer-grade devices (e.g., Apple Watch). In this work, you will investigate the factors that may influence classification performance and use machine learning techniques to boost the performance of classification results. Alternative, you could build an apple watch app for sleep monitoring.

  ### **PPG-based Ambulatory Atrial Fibrillation Monitoring Algorithm Development**


  Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia and a major risk factor for stroke. Diagnosis is usually made by observing an electrocardiogram (ECG), which is usually measured using a cardiac event recorder, such as Holter monitor, or chest patch. Photoplethysmography (PPG) is an emerging technology that enables non-invasive heart rhythm measurement through optical sensing. Continuous and accurate detection of AF from PPG has the potential to transform low-cost consumer wearable devices into clinically useful medical monitoring tools in a mass scale. In this work, you will develop deep learning models or an app to continuously and accurately detect AF episodes in PPG collected in an ambulatory free-living setting.


  Some Example works:

  ### Federated Learning for Privacy-Preserving AI


  Wearables are everywhere - from Apple Watch, Garmin and Fitbit brands to free smartphone apps. These wearable devices can collect real-time data related to user health, such as user behaviour, mood, sleep, etc., which have great commercial and social value. Traditional deep learning models for sleep analysis and human activity recognition are often trained on large datasets hosted on the cloud. This data is usually collected by wearable devices, regardless of time and place, uploading the data to the cloud can easily make the wearable device’s systems vulnerable to attacks and data breaches. In this regard, how to use healthcare wearable devices to collect data while ensuring data security and user privacy is a problem worthy of research. In this project, you will research cutting-edge federated learning techniques for building privacy-preserving Healthcare AI systems.

  ### **Data Science Project (IDEA-FAST Fatigue and Sleep Monitoring Using Wearable Devices)**


  The IDEA-FAST project is a 5½-year IMI2 project under Call H2020-JTI-IMI2-2018-15-two-stage – digital endpoints in neurodegenerative and immune-mediated diseases (total budget €42 Million) that starts in November 2019, run by a consortium of 46 partners across 15 countries in Europe. It aims to identify digital endpoints that provide a reliable, objective and sensitive evaluation of activities of daily life (ADL), disability and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) for the following neurodegenerative diseases (NDD): Parkinson’s Disease (PD), Huntington’s Disease (HD) and the following immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMID): Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), Primary Sjögren’s Syndrome (PSS), and Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). In this project, you will work on building a machine learning/deep learning model to monitor fatigue and sleep based on sensor signals in the context of physical activities. You will also have the opportunity to work with world-leading data scientists from Janssens, Pfizer and VTT
