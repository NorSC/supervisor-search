  I have been working on the application side of the information systems. My
  research falls into two broad areas: the strategic aspect of information
  systems and the individual behavior of the information systems.  


  At the strategic level, I works on how the information systems can transform organizational structure, change the organizational culture, change the business processes. Specifically, this could refers to how smart city infrastructure is desighed with technologies in areas of internet of things, smart home, smart living, smart health, Fin-Tech. This could also refers to how the artifical intelligence is change the business process of a certain area, including energy consumption, health diagnosic methods, tourism process, and many other interesting areas happening. 


  S﻿ome successful BSc project example in this area:


  Smart City Strategic Design with Simulation Method


  H﻿ow the Blockchain Technology can be Designed to Change the Existing Pension System


  V﻿arious diease prediction with machine learning


  P﻿roperty Management System


  A﻿t the individual level, I work on human behavior with technology involvement. Specifically, I work on how the technology can influence human behavior, e.g., personal shopping behavior, personal wellbeing change, personal consumption behavioral change. Some successful example past projects:


  I﻿ncrease the wellbeing of the eldly people with the design of the smart mirror


  O﻿nline recommendation Systems for Personal Education


  O﻿nline Recommendation Systems for Smart Energy Choice


  F﻿or industrial links, I have links with several local business that can work with.


  F﻿or data analysis, I am good at both qualitative and quantitative. No hard skills, from SPSS to Python. From interview to questionnare to algorithms such as Decision Tree, SVM, etc. 




  I﻿ wish to have a pleasant journey with you.
