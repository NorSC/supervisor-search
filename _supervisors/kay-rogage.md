additional_details: I have an interest in Digital Living - in particular the
  intersection between people, technology and buildings. This includes a range
  of areas from using smart speakers (Alexa/Google Home) to support assistive
  living routines to capturing data about buildings to support maintenance
  activities to reimagining heritage archives as digital interventions in city
  spaces. I do a lot of work with IoT, data capture, analysis (with machine
  learning) and visualisation - think digital dashboards. I work with a variety
  of end-users from older adults within their homes to workers on construction
  sites. In particular I am interested in new ways of supporting existing
  routines through technology in the context of buildings. I have a ton of
  industry practice and all my research is carried out with industry partners
  developing cutting edge innovation in the built environment.
