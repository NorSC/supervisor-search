additional_details: "I have an interest in Digital Living - in particular the
  intersection between people, technology and buildings. This includes a range
  of areas from using smart speakers (Alexa/Google Home) to support assistive
  living routines to capturing data about buildings to support maintenance
  activities to reimagining heritage archives as digital interventions in city
  spaces. I do a lot of work with IoT, data capture, analysis (with machine
  learning) and visualisation - think digital dashboards. I work with a variety
  of end-users from older adults within their homes to workers on construction
  sites. In particular I am interested in new ways of supporting existing
  routines through technology in the context of buildings. I have a ton of
  industry practice and all my research is carried out with industry partners
  developing cutting edge innovation in the built environment.


  Current project ideas include:\r

  1. Developing methods for supporting organisations to benchmark and evidence
  strategies around responsible computing for tackling climate change issues and
  sustainability agendas.

  \r

  2. Exploring opportunities for making sense out of IoT environmental data
  for supporting building management.\r

  3. Designing accessible controls for managing home comfort – this is an
  exploratory project which can take many forms such as looking at how you can
  use smart speakers to control your smart thermostat if you can’t see the
  screen.\r

  4. Designing a digital manual for managing the home.\r

  6. Designing new interfaces for influencing occupant behaviours within the
  home – designing, prototyping and evaluating new interfaces for interacting
  with buildings.\r\n"

  I am also doing some exciting work in the digital twin space developing a
  digital twin of our very own CIS building.
