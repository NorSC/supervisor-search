  I have an interest in Digital Living - in particular the intersection between
  people, technology and buildings. This includes a range of areas from using
  smart speakers (Alexa/Google Home) to support assistive living routines to
  capturing data about buildings to support maintenance activities to
  reimagining heritage archives as digital interventions in city spaces. I do a
  lot of work with IoT, data capture, analysis (with machine learning) and
  visualisation - think digital dashboards. I work with a variety of end-users
  from older adults within their homes to workers on construction sites. In
  particular I am interested in new ways of supporting existing routines through
  technology in the context of buildings. I have a ton of industry practice and
  all my research is carried out with industry partners developing cutting edge
  innovation in the built environment.


  In addition to my usual projects this year I am CIS lead for the Seaton Delaval Hall Design Challenge which is part of the National Trust's Rising Stars 'The Curtain Rises' project <https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/seaton-delaval-hall/projects/the-curtain-rises-project-at-seaton-delaval-hall>.


  If you want to take part in the design challenge or just want to base your project around an idea relating to Seaton Delaval Hall let me know and I can provide you with some detail on how to do this. You don't have to have your project supervised by me to do a project that relates to Seaton Delaval Hall and your work could be exhibited at the hall if the project is successful.
