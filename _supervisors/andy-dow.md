additional_details: >-
  I am an HCI researcher currently working on projects that engage local
  community sector organisations such as charities, and the people that they
  work with, in technology design. I am interested in how design can be more
  inclusive for all and the role of technology to make a difference, so I have a
  particular focus on inclusive design methods as well as better understanding
  the role that technologies play in many aspects of society. 


  If you have a Human-Computer Interaction or Interaction Design based project idea in mind I would be very happy to discuss that with you. Equally, if you are thinking along the lines of any of the themes and keywords above, I would be keen to hear your ideas and help you to develop them further, so do get in touch (andrew.dow@northumbria.ac.uk).
