  My research is in the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and I am
  currently working on projects that engage local community and public sector
  organisations such as charities, community-interest-companies, local
  government and the people that they work with, in technology design. I am
  interested in how design can be more inclusive for all and the role of
  technology to make a difference in people's lives, so I have a particular
  focus on inclusive design methods as well as better understanding the role
  that technologies play in many aspects of society. 


  In the past, I have supervised projects looking at designing new mobile applications supporting people with their health or wellbeing, or designing new ways to deliver public or charity services in new and innovative ways. Other topics I have supervised include investigations into using IoT technologies to improve citizen experience of the urban environment and carrying out sentiment analysis on large datasets (i.e. Twitter) in order to assess public feeling about particular issues.


  If you have a Human-Computer Interaction or Interaction Design based project idea in mind I would be very happy to discuss that with you. Equally, if you are interested in working with local charity organiations or thinking along the lines of any of the themes and keywords above, I would be keen to hear your ideas and help you to develop them further, so do get in touch (andrew.dow@northumbria.ac.uk).
