  My research is in the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and I am
  currently working on projects that engage local community and public sector
  organisations such as charities, community-interest-companies (CICs), local
  government and the people that they work with, in technology design. I am
  interested in how design can be more inclusive for all and the role of
  technology to make a difference in people's lives, so I have a particular
  focus on inclusive design methods as well as better understanding the role
  that technologies play in many aspects of society.


  In the past, I have supervised projects looking at designing new mobile applications supporting people and their support workers/families with their health or wellbeing, or designing new ways to deliver public or charity services in new and innovative ways. Other topics I have supervised include investigations into using IoT technologies to improve citizen experience of the urban environment and NLP projects visualising public opinion about particular issues.


  I’m interested in participatory and user-centred design and supervising HCI projects, some projects of interest to me include:


  **"Supporting informal carers to care"** - this project explores the role of technology to help informal carers (a role increasingly people are having to do for their older friends and family, often while juggling busy lives) to care for loved ones.


  Example paper(s):


  Ticket to Talk: Supporting Conversation between Young People and People with Dementia through Digital Media ( <https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3173574.3173949>)


  Connecting Those That Care: Designing for Transitioning, Talking, Belonging and Escaping ( <https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3025453.3025715>)


  **"Accessible planner and communication technologies"** - people with a cognitive impairment, learning disability may struggle to use existing calendar applications or digital networking/communication tech. From innovative conversational agent use (Alexa, Google Home) to more intuitive, visual ways of reminding people about important events, this project explores how can we design a more inclusive way of keeping people on top of their schedule.


  Example paper(s):


  Situated Buttons: A User Interface to Support Users with Complex Needs and Promote Independent Living ( <https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3411763.3451828>)


  The participatory design of a sound and image enhanced daily planner for people with aphasia (<https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/985692.985744>)


  **"Scaffolding participation in film making, meaning making and story telling."** - stories are everywhere and digital film is a fantastic medium for communicating ideas and capturing the voice of citizens in society. This project explores the use of digital tech in demystifying and supporting the process of capturing and telling stories that matter in new and innovative ways. We all have access to digital tools for capturing and sharing video in a variety of ways, how can this be used to impact society and make positive change for good?


  Example paper(s):


  Bootlegger: Turning Fans into Film Crew ( <https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2702123.2702229>)


  Beyond Participatory Production: Digitally Supporting Grassroots Documentary (<https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2745197.2755518>)


  **"AI Authoring and support: exploring the role of AI tools in creative writing"** - Increasingly the power for AI tools is available to all and this extends to the creative sphere, where Amazon have recently limited the number of books authors can upload to sell on their platform to 3 a day such is the increase in productivity. Using AIs in creative processes is still problematic, with issues relating to the threat to authenticity and creativity, yet the potential is there for them to offer support. This project looks at designing an interface that allows seamless integration of AI tools for creativity support into the creative writers' practice.


  Example paper(s):


  Creative Writing with a Machine in the Loop: Case Studies on Slogans and Stories (<https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3172944.3172983>)


  Social Dynamics of AI Support in Creative Writing (<https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3544548.3580782>)


  **"PlaceME: Making work placements accessible for CIS students"**- We know that an industry placement year as part of your degree is extremely valuable, yet not all students are able to do one. There are many challenges to address, how to find them, where to find advice on securing them, understanding the related processes and getting guidance about them. And there are many more challenges once on placement. This project explores simple digital solutions to make placement opportunities more legible and accessible to all.


  Example paper:


  Positive Feedback and Self-Reflection: Features to Support Self-efficacy among Underrepresented Job Seekers (<https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376717>)


  If you have a Human-Computer Interaction or Interaction Design based project idea in mind I would be very happy to discuss that with you. Equally, if you are interested in working with local charity organisations or thinking along the lines of any of the themes and keywords above, I would be keen to hear your ideas and help you to develop them further, so do get in touch (andrew.dow@northumbria.ac.uk)
