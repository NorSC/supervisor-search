  **Business Focused, Smart Related, Industry Based, Research Based**


  Holding a PhD in Management Information Systems from The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Dr. Honglei Li has rich research expertise in smart cities, artificial intelligence, business process management, virtual communities, virtual worlds, electronic commerce, machine learning, and social media.


  #### Past successful supervision projects


  I have supervised many undergraduate projects mainly on artificial intelligence from the business application areas, for example, smart mirror for digital living with disability, smart home app, customer relationship management system for SMEs like a garage, e-commerce website for sports products, social sharing travelling website, and fashion community website. I would welcome most business related projects. 


  I have also supervised investigative projects such as user experience testing and user experience design, social media word of mouth. 


  I also welcome any projects focusing on Internet of Things or smart devices. I have supervised smart mirror and smart home products in this perspective. I have a series of wearable devices such as tracking devices and apple iWatch for experiments. Students who would like to do the application research on wearable technology topic are also welcomed.


  In 2021, I am working on smart city projects and recommendation systems. I am also interested in working with any feasibility study for facial recognition and image processing technologies. I am working on using facial recognition technology in access control, banking, and retailing sector. I am also interested in projected related disease and pest diagnosis with image processing method. 


  **Here are some examples of potential projects**


  #### Industrial Based Project


  ###### 1.Developmentof An Intelligent Roommate Finding Systems for A property Management System


  The project involves development of an intelligent roommate finding systems so that tenants can find roommates easily. The project is a collaboration with [road51.com](http://road51.com/).


  #### Research-Based Project


  ###### 7.Co-Citation Analysis for Virtual Community Studies


  The research projects aims at review the virtual community literature from 1985 to current with a systematic method—co-citation analysis. The project will use the co-citation methods. It will involves coding past literature on virtual communities from various disciplines. There are about 900 papers to be coded and analyzed. The project will be collaborated with an associate professor from Exeter University.Students who are interested in doing a PhD are encouraged to take up this project.
