  I am an UX designer with a particular passion in user testing and UX design;
  my research is principally in the area of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and
  Information Retrieval (IR). My research addresses the significant interaction
  and retrieval challenges facing users and designers within an age of
  ubiquitous computing. 


  From an information science perspective, I am interested in the role that misinformation has on human behaviour and currently involved in a range of studies evaluating the impact of misinformation, disinformation and blatant fake news has on interaction behaviour and well-being online.


  As a side-line, which could support project ideas within CIS, is my interest and engagement with regional businesses partially as they test and evaluate digital products. These ongoing collaborations could support project ideas with potential tangible outputs for students as they create portfolio of digital products and evidence to support future.


  Project Themes:


  \- Evaluating the effects of fragmented attention on interaction behaviour within a mobile context i.e. web search tasks. 


  \-﻿ Exploring the relationship between eye fixations (a measure of attention) and duration (a measure of concentration) on a range of online articles and levels of information discernment (a sub-process of information literacy characterising how participants make judgements about information).


  \-﻿ Using eye tracking to understand banner blindness and improve online environments


  \-﻿ The effects of simulated interruptions on mobile search tasks


  \-Understanding the Impact of Auditory Distraction on interaction behaviour i.e., Web Search Tasks

  **I am the deputy research lead in Digital Health and Wellbeing (DH&W)
  focusing on developing human-centred and accessible digital solutions to
  address unmet healthcare needs.**


  A particular emphasis is on algorithm development and digital biomarkers using wearable technologies and mobile computing to understand mechanistic (e.g., cognitive) as well as lifestyle factors in ageing (Godfrey, Alshabrawy, Rooksby, Pointon). Recognising the societal importance of this human centric approach, staff (Akhtar, Warner, Anwar, Sice, Elvin) research digital health challenges pertaining to vulnerable groups and information retrieval for decision support systems. We also research digital medicine-based topics in e.g., cancer-focused bioinformatics & functional genomics (Kurt, Woo).
