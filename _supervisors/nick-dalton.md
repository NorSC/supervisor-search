  ### Also, I am good at working with students with disabilities ( dyslexia,
  autism spectrum, ADHD)


  ## BFL Future Programming languages for Beginners


  <https://github.com/sheepdalton/BFL>


  BFL (Big Falcon Language) or (Beginners Falcon Language) Is a new programming language inspired by HyperTalk and Python. It's designed to be a powerful and correct learner language. This is a work in progress.


  BFL is intended to be a full programming language - if you see the documentation you will see the developing tutorial. The language began by writing the tutorial not all aspects of the introduction exist or are certain to make it into version 1.0


  The MVP ( *Minimal Viable Product* ) is an interactive command line based calculator. It shows off some of the aspects of BFL philosophy which will be apparent in the final language. 


  You could test this out on students or write another backend or extend the language. 


  **Requires very good java programming skills, use of Netbeans IDE, Github**


  ## Data Visualization for diabetes patients


   AIM: to take given data recorded from a patient with diabetes. Develop visualization mechanisms that will create insight into the reasons for blood glucose levels fluctuation. Test visualization mechanisms for their ability to gain insight.


  Description: Type 1 Diabetes is a serious condition that demands careful balancing of lifestyle and medication to avoid serious complications. Current mobile health approaches for diabetes management are usually either automated insulin delivery systems or logbooks that depend on manual data collection and reflection. Both have their shortcomings such as loss of engagement and autonomy in the former approach, or fatigue and cognitive stress in the latter. 


  Developments in continuous blood glucose monitoring bring more information than ever before to the patient hands. The urgent problem is trying to interpret this information such that the patient and the doctor are able to create insight into the causes of blood glucose level fluctuation. This project will begin with a dataset of a variety of measured values taken from a real patient with diabetes. The objective will be to create a number of visualizations ( possibly interactive ) that look at the data in new ways with the ambition of creating new insights.


  Once the visualization are created they will be tested to observe the effectiveness of insight creation.


  **Neurodiversity**\

  Recent years has seen the development of an alternative view of many cognitive disabilities such as dyslexia autism ADHD etc. Neuro diversity is a political stance taken by some in the disabled community for a number of specific conditions. It proposes that these conditions should be viewed as differences across the spectrum of human beings rather than pure deficits. Theorists of neurodiversity suggest that what makes a number of neurodiverse conditions different is that they have a number of up-sides. From a computing perspective, this leads to an interesting question about how to design user interfaces to take advantage of these abilities. For example, with dyslexia and ADHD those with these differences are typically more highly creative than Neurotypical individuals. What would user interfaces and applications are designed to support high creativity would look like and operate? Another example is autism spectrum, it is known that many on the autistic spectrum have both perfect pitch and the ability to easily search large images for specific details ( such as the were is Wally pictures). How might user interfaces specifically take advantage of these abilities? 


  Note best to stick to adults dyslexia/adhd as it would be difficult to get ethical permission to work with children and those with more profound differences over the life of a masters project. 


  *Previous projects* 


  The device to continuously record audio and capture only the last 3 to 5 minutes of speech ( retrospectively) this will be converted to text informed up as notes about the day. This is designed for dyslexic users who have poor short-term audio memories.

  **Possible projects**


  **Education**


  Do you feel free t think about projects that involve aspects such as the teaching of programming.  This also includes the Gamification of programming and the construction of methods to identify and deal with plagiarism in code. I'm particularly interested in looking at behavioural models with learning to program.


  **Plagurisum detection**


  Code Plagiarism is a complex problem in computer science student projects and assessment. This would project would look at ways of identifying plagiarism and collaboration in during of student software projects.


  **Replace Exams with behaviour tracking**


  A simple IDE (online or standalone ) help teach either Python or Java as a replacement for exams. This would use analysis of typing and the model of software construction ( editing,  compiling, syntax error, editing) to identify students working. By looking at Student behaviour it may be possible to identify students who are not engaging with the educational process, along with students who were struggling you could then be targeted for additional work. 


  Another project would be looking on GitHub for large pure Java projects.  These projects would be suitable for second-year students to examine as part of program design and development course. The idea would be to create a curated collection of large-scale pure Java projects which will be suitable for second-year programming students ( so not using items they have not encountered ). The curated collection would identify a list of algorithmic and design strengths and weaknesses for each project. The output of the project would be both the collection and the list of design strengths/weaknesses of each project to allow the collection to be used by academics globally in the teaching of large scale design projects. 


  **Navigation** 


  Alzheimer's and Parkinson's are a growing concern to many modern populations. Recently the game was released called sea hero quest to collect data about peoples ability to navigate. This has created terabytes of data regarding peoples navigational behaviours. The project would be to take some or all of this data and by using a splay tree try to compress the information into a more tractable form. By visualising using a tree it may be possible to look for categories and outliers in the motion data. Note this cannot be done with artificial intelligence or data science methods it's more of a pure programming visualisation process. 


  **Converting graphs into axial maps**


  Graph theory has a number of ways of laying out graphs visually. Axial maps used in space syntax are converted from the actual layout to graph form. However, the graph form is far less desirable than the actual form. This means that the axial form could be seen as a form of graph representation. The objective of this thesis would be to see if it is possible to take a standard  (non urban ) graph and convert it into a quasi axial form, and so improve its legibility. 


  **Slow information** 


  This project would involve the creation of a robot which used two sets of strings to hang on a vertical surface such as a whiteboard. By adjusting the length of each string it would be possible to move a whiteboard pen across the surface. Much in the manner of a floor-based turtle. The objective this project will be to build the robot from scratch and then create the software to allow it to write/draw on a whiteboard.  This would allow large services to be used as slow information services ( areas where information changes but slowly over weeks/days) 


  **Vivacious interaction**\

  Sedentary behaviour has been linked to obesity and is one of the leading causes of preventable death. It has been suggested that the rise of the use of computing in the workplace has significantly contributed to an increase in sedentary behaviour.  This project reports on work to counter this by developing what is termed ‘Vivacious interaction’. This is a new type of whole body interaction combined with standard desktop presentation with a focus on workplace style activities. This project would involve creating devices using an Arduino to attach to under desk elliptical trainers and then using them to control aspects of user interaction such as screen scrolling. The Objective would be to measure if doing two tasks separately ( peddling and using the computer ) has dissimilar cognitive load to doing both tasks together (using peddling to control the computer ).


  **Space syntax - neighbourhood finding.** 


  Previous work has been done to show it is possible to extract the regions of local neighbourhoods from space syntax axial models. This is done by using graph theory to compute particular values of synergy and intelligibility.  The objective here would be to try to reproduce this work in another urban context and then extend the underlying graph theory to look at alternative formations and the use of other representations ( such as segmental angular models )
