  My personal interests are mainly around IT Service Management, Enterprise
  systems, Business Processes, Business Information Systems, IT
  operations,  success metrics, transactional processing and systems
  implementation issues.


  My preference is for real industry projects either for a specific client or inspired by observation/identification of a real problem or issue (often from placement). In many of the most interesting (and successful) cases, the complexity and interest is in identifying and specifying the necessary business processes and constraints rather than in the final application. 


  I usually focus on ITMB projects.

  I have a background of Enterprise Systems implementation and am more
  interested in the business rational and functional use of systems and their
  transactional and master data than the technical programming of them.

(I would like to investigate "process mining" but haven't managed to free up the time yet.)
