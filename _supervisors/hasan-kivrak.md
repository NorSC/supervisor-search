  My research interests span the fields of **Robotics and AI**, encompassing
  areas such as **Autonomous Systems**, **Cyber Physical Systems**,
  **Human-robot Interaction**. If you're passionate about exploring the exciting
  world of robotics and artificial intelligence and want to gain hands-on
  experience in that kind of projects, you may consider the following ideas:


  1. **Exploring Robotics Basics:** This project is ideal for those eager to understand the fundamentals of robotics. You will work on tasks like programming, sensor integration, and basic control algorithms to grasp the core concepts of robotics.

  2. **Sensor Analysis and Fusion:** Gain insight into the world of sensors, their data, and how to fuse information from multiple sensors. Explore topics like Kalman filtering, object detection, and recognition.

  3. **Robot Control:** Learn the essentials of robot control through a PID control project. This hands-on experience will teach you how to make a robot move smoothly and accurately.

  4. **Mapping and Navigation:** Gain insight into mapping, localization, and path planning. You'll develop skills in building maps, tracking robot positions, and planning efficient paths for robots.

  5. **Material Handling:** Tackle practical challenges in robotics, such as object manipulation, grasping, and transport. Work on projects involving finding, picking up, and returning objects, enhancing your manipulation skills.

  6. **Cyber Physical System Architecture Design:** Explore the integration of digital twin technologies with robotics for rapid design, development, and deployment in remote and industrial applications. This project offers a glimpse into the future of robotics in industry.


  **Additionally,** I'm happy to discuss any ideas you may have regarding the application of Robotics and AI, as well as machine learning to sensor data, images, or video, in order to explore what is achievable with robots.
