  My research interests are mostly around computing education or education more
  broadly. In terms of projects I am happy to supervise:


  1. Client based projects - if you have a client you want to build something for, for example whoever you completed your placement for, or a local club or society. An element of novelty / challenge is expected i.e. its not just about building something, it is building something that you have to complete some background research upon in order to build it.

  2. Projects with an educational dimension. Please remember all our projects have to include the use of the practical skills you have learned on your Programme of study.

  For masters projects, being informed by research is pivotal, so care needs to be taken with client based projects to ensure they evidence an appropriate challenge.
