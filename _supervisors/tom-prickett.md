  My research interests are mostly around computing education or education more
  broadly. In terms of projects, I am happy to supervise:


  1. Projects with an educational dimension. Please remember all our projects have to include the use of the practical skills you[](<1. https://doi.org/10.1109/ICGS3.2019.8688137>) have learned on your Programme of study.

  2. Client based projects - if you have a client you want to build something for, for example whoever you completed your placement for, or a local club or society. An element of novelty / challenge is expected i.e., it’s not just about building something, it is building something that you must complete some background research upon in order to build it.


  The above are probably very focused upon software development. A more research oriented idea could be to have a look at [](<1. https://doi.org/10.1109/ICGS3.2019.8688137>)<https://doi.org/10.1109/ICGS3.2019.8688137>. Could you configure a web-crawler to re-run this experiment but only look at learning outcomes and hence content that is likely to be assessed? You could do this looking at security or sustainability.

  For masters’ projects, being informed by research is pivotal, so care needs to be taken with client based projects to ensure they evidence an appropriate challenge and the word is underpinned by a research investigation.
