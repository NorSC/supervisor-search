  My research interests are mostly around computing education. In terms of
  projects very happy to supervise:


  1. Client based projects - if you have a client you want to build something for, for example whoever you completed your placement for, or a local club or society or something you want to prototype as you are considering setting up your own business next year. Typically these are software engineering / development projects. 

  2. Projects with an educational dimension. Please remember all our projects have to include the use of the practical skills you have learned on your Programme of study.
     Feel free to drop me an email and we shall arrange a convenient time for a conversation.
