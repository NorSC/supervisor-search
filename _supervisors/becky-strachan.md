  I work full time. I have three drop in hours per week where students can just
  drop in to see me. These are Wednesdays 9.30 - 11am and Thursdays 3.30-
  5pm.  If you would like a specific time during this period, just contact me
  via email to book an appointment.


  My office is ELB112 on the first floor of B Block, Ellison Building and my work phone no is 0191 227 3606.

  My main research interests are in using technology to enhance education and open up opportunities for people irrespective of their backgrounds, environment and culture. This is across a person’s lifetime from early years to college/university to lifelong learning. I am also interested in exploring how we can further enhance the education and student experience particularly in the computer science and wider STEM disciplines. I am also interested in the end user experience of technology more widely and also in how to embed sustainability into technology practices.

  I particularly like using action and participatory research methods.


  H﻿ere are some of my current ideas for Undergraduate Final Year Projects:


  1﻿. ***Development of a Gamified Online Resource to Educate Students about Good Academic Practice and how to Avoid Academic Misconduct.***


  H﻿igher education is witnessing an increase in the cases of academic misconduct including contract cheating and plagiarism. This project would look at developing a set of online resources to educate students about how to use good academic practice and avoid academic misconduct. It would ideally use a gamified approach to provide a more playful learning environment and focus on students in the computer science disciplines.


  ***R﻿elated Reading***


  E﻿uropean Network for Academic Integrity. This has a wealth of resources including a self-evaluation tool for students. See <https://www.academicintegrity.eu/wp/> and [https://www.academicintegrity.eu/survey](https://www.academicintegrity.eu/survey/)

  2﻿. ***Inclusive Educational Resources and Practice: A Good Practice Guide*** 

  There is still a gender imbalance in computer science and computer science education in the UK. This is mirrored elsewhere too. This project would develop an online guide for good practice around inclusive educational resources , focusing on the computer science disciplines.

  T﻿hese are just a couple of ideas but I would be happy to discuss other ideas that you may have related to my areas of interest.

  Here are some of my current ideas for Masters level research topics:


  1. ***Co-Creating Solutions with Students to Encourage Good Academic Practice with a focus on Combatting Plagiarism***
     Despite the provision of numerous resources and advice and guidance on plagiarism, the Higher Education sector in the UK and elsewhere is still experiencing a significant number of cases of student plagiarism each year. This research study would use participatory action research to work with a set of students at Northumbria to explore their attitudes and behaviour towards academic misconduct and co-design a set of resources/approaches with them to encourage good academic practice and reduce cases of plagiarism within the wider student body.

  2. ***Co-Creating Digital Induction Resources for Postgraduate International Computer Science Students***
     There is evidence that international students in the UK can find I difficult to adapt to our way of education. We are also seeing increasing numbers of international students particularly at postgraduate levels and in disciplines such as computer science and business. This project will adopt exploratory research, working with a group of students to understand their experience of starting their postgraduate programmes with a view to developing a set of online induction resources to provide better support in the future.

  3. ***Inclusive Educational Resources and Practice: A Case Study in Computer Science at Northumbria University*** 
     There is still a gender imbalance in computer science and computer science education in the UK. This is mirrored elsewhere too. This research would use the computer science provision at Northumbria University to investigate the extent to which its educational resources and practice are inclusive. The research would employ an exploratory research approach.

  These are just some of the ideas I have had regarding possible research. We also have a set of data from Nigeria about online learning during the COVID Pandemic that could be made available to anybody interested in exploring online school education provision during COVID. I would also be happy to discuss other ideas you may have.

  My main research interests are in using digital technology to enhance education and open up opportunities for people irrespective of their backgrounds, environment and culture. This is across a person’s lifetime from early years to college/university to lifelong learning. I am also interested in exploring how we can further enhance the education and student experience particularly in the computer science and wider STEM disciplines. This includes developing career knowledge and aspirations among young people to ensure we have a more diverse and inclusive STEM sector for the future. I am also interested more generally in the end user experience of digital technology and computing systems.


  I am interested in supervising PhD students in the areas of technology enhanced learning, digital literacy/digital fluency and computer science education. I particularly like using action and participatory research methods.
