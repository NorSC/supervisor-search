  My main research interests are in using technology to enhance education and open up opportunities for people irrespective of their backgrounds, environment and culture. This is across a person’s lifetime from early years to college/university to lifelong learning. I am also interested in exploring how we can further enhance the education and student experience particularly in the computer science and wider STEM disciplines. I am also interested in the end user experience of technology more widely and also in how to embed sustainability into technology practices.

  I particularly like using action and participatory research methods.


  H﻿ere are some of my current ideas for Undergraduate Final Year Projects:


  **1. Development of a Student Centred Gamified Online Resource to Educate Students about Good Academic Practice and how to Avoid Academic Misconduct**


  Higher education is witnessing an increase in the cases of academic misconduct including contract cheating and plagiarism. This project would look at developing a set of student centred online resources to educate students about how to use good academic practice and avoid academic misconduct. It would ideally work with a set of student to understand their requirements and then use a gamified approach to provide a more playful learning environment with a focus on students in the computer science disciplines.

  **2. Generative AI Tools for Conducting and Writing a Critical Literature Review: An Online Good Practice Guid**e


  Generative AI and associated tools based on this technology have been developing quickly over the past year. Many of these tools can help students in their studies but care needs to be taken to ensure students are still active learners in this process. Several of these tools particularly apply to searching and evaluating the literature. This project will focus on these tools to explore the design and development of an online good practice guide for such tools aimed at the final year and postgraduate student.

  **3. Practical Research Methods in Computer Science: An Interactive Guide**


  We teach research methods to many of our computing students. However, it is always useful to have specific examples to illustrate these concepts. This project would take some of our existing research as academic staff and produce an interactive educational resource to provide illustrative examples of applying at least 2 different research methods and analysing the results for our students.

  These are just a couple of ideas but I would be happy to discuss other ideas that you may have related to my areas of interest.

  Here are some of my current ideas for Masters level research topics:


  ***1.Co-Creating a Digital Interactive Educational Resource on Academic Integrity and Good Academic Practice.***

  There is some evidence to suggest that students are committing academic misconduct through ignorance or a lack of knowledge and understanding of academic integrity and how to use good academic practice in their work. This project would work with a group of students in a participatory manner to understand their needs and develop and trial an online interactive educational resource around academic integrity and good academic practice.

  ***2. Inclusive Educational Resources and Practice: A Case Study in Computer Science at Northumbria University.***\

  There is still a gender imbalance in computer science and computer science education in the UK. This is mirrored elsewhere too. This research would use the computer science provision at Northumbria University to investigate the extent to which its educational resources and practice are inclusive. The research would employ an exploratory research approach.

  ***3. Open AI, GPT-3 and CHATGPT - Opportunities to Support more Inclusive Student Learning***\

  There has been a great deal of interest in the recent developments around natural language processing and in particular ChatGPT and related tools. These can generate content and code. Although there are concerns about their use, they also have the potential to be really useful tools. This project will look at their application particularly to provide a more inclusive learning experience and support for students. This is likely to adopt an action research and/or participatory research approach, working closely with students and/or academic staff to explore how to incorporate these tools within a learning environment to enhance its inclusivity.

  These are just some of the ideas I have had regarding possible research. We also have a set of data from Nigeria about online learning during the COVID Pandemic that could be made available to anybody interested in exploring online school education provision during COVID. I would also be happy to discuss other ideas you may have.

This includes developing career knowledge and aspirations among young people to ensure we have a more diverse and inclusive STEM sector for the future. I am also interested more generally in the end user experience of digital technology and computing systems.


  I am interested in supervising PhD students in the areas of technology enhanced learning, digital literacy/digital fluency and computer science education. I particularly like using action and participatory research methods.
