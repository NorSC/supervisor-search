  I work full time. I have three drop in hours per week where students can just
  drop in to see me. These are Wednesdays 9.30 - 11am and Thursdays 3.30-
  5pm.  If you would like a specific time during this period, just contact me
  via email to book an appointment.


  My office is ELB112 on the first floor of B Block, Ellison Building and my work phone no is 0191 227 3606.

  My main research interests are in using technology to enhance education - this is across the whole education system from early years to college/university to lifelong learning. I am also interested in exploring how we can enhance and innovate the education and the student experience for computer science and digital technology students. Finally I have worked on projects that have explored how to provide a more inclusive educational environment and how we can ensure that everyone irrespective of their background or experiences is digitally fluent, both here in the UK and globally.

  Here are some of my current ideas for Masters level research topics:


  1. ***Co-Creating Solutions with Students to Encourage Good Academic Practice with a focus on Combatting Plagiarism***
     Despite the provision of numerous resources and advice and guidance on plagiarism, the Higher Education sector in the UK and elsewhere is still experiencing a significant number of cases of student plagiarism each year. This research study would use participatory action research to work with a set of students at Northumbria to explore their attitudes and behaviour towards academic misconduct and co-design a set of resources/approaches with them to encourage good academic practice and reduce cases of plagiarism within the wider student body.

  2. ***Co-Creating Digital Induction Resources for Postgraduate International Computer Science Students***
     There is evidence that international students in the UK can find I difficult to adapt to our way of education. We are also seeing increasing numbers of international students particularly at postgraduate levels and in disciplines such as computer science and business. This project will adopt exploratory research, working with a group of students to understand their experience of starting their postgraduate programmes with a view to developing a set of online induction resources to provide better support in the future.

  3. ***Inclusive Educational Resources and Practice: A Case Study in Computer Science at Northumbria University*** 
     There is still a gender imbalance in computer science and computer science education in the UK. This is mirrored elsewhere too. This research would use the computer science provision at Northumbria University to investigate the extent to which its educational resources and practice are inclusive. The research would employ an exploratory research approach.

  These are just some of the ideas I have had regarding possible research. We also have a set of data from Nigeria about online learning during the COVID Pandemic that could be made available to anybody interested in exploring online school education provision during COVID. I would also be happy to discuss other ideas you may have.

  I am interested in supervising PhD students in the areas of technology enhanced learning, digital literacy/digital fluency and computer science education. I also have a research interest in improving STEM education and career knowledge/aspirations among young people to ensure we have a more diverse and inclusive STEM sector for the future.  I particularly like using action and participatory research methods.
