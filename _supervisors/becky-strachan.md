  I work full time. I have two drop in hours per week where students can just
  drop in to see me. These are Tuesdays 3-5pm.  If you would like a specific
  time during this period, just contact me via email to book an appointment.


  My office is ELB112 on the first floor of B Block, Ellison Building and my work phone no is 0191 227 3606.

  My main research interests are in using technology to enhance education and open up opportunities for people irrespective of their backgrounds, environment and culture. This is across a person’s lifetime from early years to college/university to lifelong learning. I am also interested in exploring how we can further enhance the education and student experience particularly in the computer science and wider STEM disciplines. I am also interested in the end user experience of technology more widely and also in how to embed sustainability into technology practices.

  I particularly like using action and participatory research methods.


  H﻿ere are some of my current ideas for Undergraduate Final Year Projects:


  1﻿. ***Development of a Gamified Online Resource to Educate Students about Good Academic Practice and how to Avoid Academic Misconduct.***


  H﻿igher education is witnessing an increase in the cases of academic misconduct including contract cheating and plagiarism. This project would look at developing a set of online resources to educate students about how to use good academic practice and avoid academic misconduct. It would ideally use a gamified approach to provide a more playful learning environment and focus on students in the computer science disciplines.


  ***R﻿elated Reading***


  E﻿uropean Network for Academic Integrity. This has a wealth of resources including a self-evaluation tool for students. See <https://www.academicintegrity.eu/wp/> and [https://www.academicintegrity.eu/survey](https://www.academicintegrity.eu/survey/)

  2﻿. ***Inclusive Educational Resources and Practice: A Good Practice Guide*** 

  There is still a gender imbalance in computer science and computer science education in the UK. This is mirrored elsewhere too. This project would develop an online guide for good practice around inclusive educational resources , focusing on the computer science disciplines.

  T﻿hese are just a couple of ideas but I would be happy to discuss other ideas that you may have related to my areas of interest.

  Here are some of my current ideas for Masters level research topics:


  ***1.Co-Creating a Digital Interactive Educational Resource on Academic Integrity and Good Academic Practice.***

  There is some evidence to suggest that students are committing academic misconduct through ignorance or a lack of knowledge and understanding of academic integrity and how to use good academic practice in their work. This project would work with a group of students in a participatory manner to understand their needs and develop and trial an online interactive educational resource around academic integrity and good academic practice.

  ***2. Inclusive Educational Resources and Practice: A Case Study in Computer Science at Northumbria University.***\

  There is still a gender imbalance in computer science and computer science education in the UK. This is mirrored elsewhere too. This research would use the computer science provision at Northumbria University to investigate the extent to which its educational resources and practice are inclusive. The research would employ an exploratory research approach.

  ***3. Open AI, GPT-3 and CHATGPT - Opportunities to Support more Inclusive Student Learning***\

  There has been a great deal of interest in the recent developments around natural language processing and in particular ChatGPT and related tools. These can generate content and code. Although there are concerns about their use, they also have the potential to be really useful tools. This project will look at their application particularly to provide a more inclusive learning experience and support for students. This is likely to adopt an action research and/or participatory research approach, working closely with students and/or academic staff to explore how to incorporate these tools within a learning environment to enhance its inclusivity.

  These are just some of the ideas I have had regarding possible research. We also have a set of data from Nigeria about online learning during the COVID Pandemic that could be made available to anybody interested in exploring online school education provision during COVID. I would also be happy to discuss other ideas you may have.

I am also interested in exploring how we can further enhance the education and student experience particularly in the computer science and wider STEM disciplines. This includes developing career knowledge and aspirations among young people to ensure we have a more diverse and inclusive STEM sector for the future. I am also interested more generally in the end user experience of digital technology and computing systems.


  I am interested in supervising PhD students in the areas of technology enhanced learning, digital literacy/digital fluency and computer science education. I particularly like using action and participatory research methods.
