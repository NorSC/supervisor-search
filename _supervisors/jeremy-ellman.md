  Tues: 15:00-16:00, Thurs: 10:00-11:00 (as of 05/10/21). But email anytime and
  put 'KV6003 Project' in the subject.


  Meetings will actually happen in 'The Hub' next the office as EB211 is crowded. Since The Hub is an open area a mask will be required.

  ### General Comment:


  These project ideas are challenging. Don't let that put you off. Generally a fair attempt at a hard project will do better than the same effort applied to some idea which is well understood. Ask for further details....


  ### Natural Language Processing (NLP)


  NLP is the computer processing or generation of language. The text in italics was generated by GPT2:


  **Project Ideas:**


  **1) Conversational Chatbot**


  The aim of this project is to generate a mobile app to answer questions based on a module content. Creating  an AI powered chatbot can be done with Rasa. This can readily be installed as an conversational Android app, that gives individual answers to separate questions. 


  The challenge is to remember the questioner and adapt answers to their current knowledge. Would students welcome such an app?


  **2) Question generation**


  The aim of this project is to generate questions and their answers from text. These can then be used in a verbal chatbot (like Alexa, Siri).  This is an active research area.


  **3) Pandas SQL**


  Did you know that to apply SQL to Data Frames, the Pandas SQL module actually writes the dataframe to a csv file,  processes the query in SQLite, and reads the results back in -- for each query! Can you do better?


  **4) Theoretical Basis for Differing standard Machine Learning Algorithms' Performance**


  It's common knowledge that some ML algos (e.g in Scikit-learn) perform better with some data sets than others, but why is that? Can we predict from the dataset distribution which ML algorithm would likely lead to better performance


  **5) Transformer predictions of violent crimes using time series**


  The level of violent crime can be predicted using statistical time series models. Can a transformer model do better? Application of transformers to time series is a hot research topic.


  **6) GANS!**


  I'd be very interested to hear any ideas you have for GANS (Generative, Adversarial networks)
