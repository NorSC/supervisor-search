  put 'KV6003 Project' in the subject.

  ### Natural Language Processing (NLP)


  NLP is the computer processing or generation of language. The text in italics was generated by GPT2:


  **Project Ideas:**


  **1) Conversational Chatbot**


  The aim of this project is to generate a mobile app to answer questions based on a module content. Creating  an AI powered chatbot can be done with Rasa. This can readily be installed as an conversational Android app, that gives individual answers to separate questions. 


  The challenge is to remember the questioner and adapt answers to their current knowledge. Would students welcome such an app?


  **2) Question generation**


  The aim of this project is to generate questions and their answers from text. These can then be used in a verbal chatbot (like Alexa, Siri).  This is an active research area.


  **3) Pandas SQL**


  Did you know that to apply SQL to Data Frames, the Pandas SQL module actually writes the dataframe to a csv file,  processes the query in SQLite, and reads the results back in -- for each query! Can you do better?
