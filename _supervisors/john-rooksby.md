  I am happy to discuss ideas related to:


  * Web development

  * Mobile development 

  * Digital health and wellbeing

  * Games

  * Web3 and blockchain

  * Anything else


  I am happy to hear ideas (especially ones that relate to your life experiences, hobbies, passions, outside interests, industry experience, big ideas, strange dreams, etc. 


  Here's a few ideas:


  * An **experience sampling** application that will capture information about what someone is doing or thinking at random times of day (see - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_sampling_method).

  * Systematically review the functionality and usability of mobile applications for managing an **addiction** or  **health condition** (You might learn how to use a scraper such as this - https://pypi.org/project/google-play-scraper/ to collect data) (See e.g. https://mental.jmir.org/2020/1/e15321/ https://mhealth.jmir.org/2019/1/e10353/)

  * Build a digital board **game** or an interactive narrative for learning about or exploring an event, a concept, or some aspect of the world (see e.g. https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3322276.3323697 https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3418038 )

  * Build a web or mobile application for **personal tracking** of expenditure, food, or productivity. You might think about building upon behaviour change techniques or using intervention design methods.

  * A game, web app or mobile app that helps students practice **mindfulness** techniques or improve their **wellbeing** (see e.g https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3025453.3025590 https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3334480.3382938)
additional_details_msc: I am happy to supervise projects relating to **web
  development**. I am also happy to supervise other software development
  projects. Suitable topics include **tracking health and wellbeing**,
  developing an **online training tool** (for a topic of your choice), or
  developing some other kind of interactive system.
