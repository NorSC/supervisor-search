  I am happy to discuss ideas related to:


  * Web development

  * Mobile development 

  * Digital health and wellbeing

  * Games

  * Web3 and blockchain

  * Anything else (almost)


  I am happy to hear your ideas (especially ones that relate to your life experiences, hobbies, passions, outside interests, industry experience, big ideas, strange dreams, etc..) If there's something you're interested in but are not quite sure how to turn it into a project I'd be happy to discuss. 


  Here are a few ideas from me:


  * An **experience sampling** application that will capture information about what someone is doing or thinking at random times of day (see - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_sampling_method).

  * A **social** or **messaging** application. You could make something similar to X (but call it Y or Threads).   

  * A **game** or interactive narrative. It could be a web-based multiplayer game or something for learning about or exploring an event, a concept, or some aspect of the world (see e.g. https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3322276.3323697 https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3418038)

  * Apps that address **worst case climate change** for example to support prepping and survivalism**.** 

  * Build a web or mobile application for **personal tracking** of expenditure, food, productivity, prayers, health conditions, etc. You might think about building upon behaviour change techniques or using intervention design methods.

  * An app that uses **Generative AI** (e.g. ChatGPT) to do something such as power a narrative based game, provide fitness coaching, or perform (mock?) project vivas. 

  * A game, web app or mobile app that helps students practice **mindfulness** techniques or improve their **wellbeing** (see e.g https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3025453.3025590 https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3334480.3382938)
additional_details_msc: I am happy to supervise projects relating to mobile and
  **web development**. I am also happy to supervise other software development
  projects. Suitable topics include **tracking health and wellbeing**,
  developing an **online training tool** (for a topic of your choice), or
  developing some other kind of interactive system.
