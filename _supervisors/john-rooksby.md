  I am happy to discuss ideas related to:


  * Games development

  * Web development

  * Mobile development 

  * Digital health and wellbeing

  * Anything really


  I am happy to hear ideas (especially ones that relate to your life experiences, hobbies, passions, outside interests, industry experience, big ideas, strange dreams, etc). 


  Here's a few ideas of my own:


  * (Software Engineering / General project) Build an "experience sampling" application that will capture information about what someone is doing or thinking at random times of day.

  * (Investigative project) Systematically review the functionality and usability of mobile applications for managing addiction or a chronic condition. 

  * (General project) Build a digital board game or an interactive narrative for learning about an historical event, a philosophical or religious concept, or a specific aspect of the natural world. 

  * (General project) Build a web or mobile application for tracking expenditure, food, or productivity. You might think about building upon behaviour change techniques or using intervention design methods.  

  * (General project) A game, web app or mobile app that helps students practice mindfulness techniques or improve their mood.

  * (Investigative / General project) Something that will try to influence your dreams (for 'use' before you sleep or when you are asleep). 


  Please note that I expect to hold supervision meetings mainly online (using MS Teams) this year - which I thought worked very well last year. If face-to-face chats are important to you I might not be your best choice.
